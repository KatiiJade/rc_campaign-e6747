The palace is named in honour of [[Characters/Socorro\|Socorro the Exile]], its founding leader. He was a refugee of war in the land of [[Atlas/Civilisations/San Citlán\|San Citlán]], and he selected one of the most beautiful complexes in [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|the Citadel]] to house the needy as they arrived. He swore that while his homeland was occupied, he would be an exile and would make his home in the Palace, alongside any others with nowhere else to go. He is still helping refugees to this day.

The Palace of Exile has spacious living quarters with adjoining gardens and recovery centers, where refugees are cared for physically, mentally, and emotionally as they make the transition to either living in the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] permanently or relocating to a new land. The Palace's staff coordinate with the [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/House of Convalescence\|House of Convalescence]] to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded.

The [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Shieldbearers\|Shieldbearers]], the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]]'s dedicated search-and-rescue force, are headquartered at the Palace of Exile. Where there is a need, the [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Shieldbearers\|Shieldbearers]] help.
