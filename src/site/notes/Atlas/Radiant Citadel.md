Against the unending mist and unseen terrors of the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]], the Radiant Citadel stands bright as a bastion of hope. It's a living relic of the ingenuity and collaboration of twenty-seven [[Atlas/Great Civilisations\|Great Civilisations]]. Abandoned and lost for ages, the Citadel was resurrected from its slumber and reclaimed by descendants of those societies, though some peoples remain missing. The city serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, a repository of histories and secrets, and a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life.

The Radiant Citadel is a miracle of architecture, a floating city carved out of a single, massive fossil that snakes around a colossal gemstone shard known as the [[Auroral Diamond\|Auroral Diamond]]. The luminescence of the [[Auroral Diamond\|Auroral Diamond]] is mirrored in the constellation of fifteen structure-sized gemstones, the [[Concord Jewels\|Concord Jewels]], which orbit the city and provide transportation to the far-flung homes of the Citadel's founding civilisations. In the haze of the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]], the [[Auroral Diamond\|Auroral Diamond]] is a scintillating beacon visible from leagues away. The diamond itself seems to have moods, changing colours unpredictably, but it is always visible for wanderers lost and in need. Just beyond the city whirls a massive, ever-threatening, ethereal cyclone known as the [[Keening Gloom\|Keening Gloom]]—a looming threat that's a grim reminder of the Citadel's precarious position.

Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in the Radiant Citadel. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid.

## Features
**Hallmarks.** The Radiant Citadel is an extraplanar refuge known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty. Local traditions of oral storytelling preserve ancestral wisdom from many worlds. 
**Population.** The majority of the Radiant Citadel's populaces comes from the Great Civilisations that govern the city. This makes the population an ethnically diverse mix of humans, dwarves, dragonborn, elves, gnomes, halflings, and tieflings along with a variety of other races.
**Languages.** Common is widely know, along with dozens of other languages and dialects.

## Legends and Lore
Two hundred and fifty years ago, the great brass dragon [[Sholeh\|Sholeh]] undertook a quest to find the Radiant Citadel. For millennia, the dragons of her lineage had recounted tales of its glory. As threats loomed on the horizon, [[Sholeh\|Sholeh]] looked to the legend of the Radiant Citadel as salvation.

[[Sholeh\|Sholeh]] gathered a mighty expeditionary force of adventurers from the civilisations she believed originally created the Radiant Citadel. Their travels took them across perilous planes and to distant worlds, and many died or gave up in despair. Only a quarter of the heroes who set out completed [[Sholeh\|Sholeh]]'s quest, but the adventurers' sacrifices were rewarded. In the depths of the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]], the Radiant Citadel lay dormant and abandoned by all but the [[Incarnates\|Incarnates]] of the [[Preserve of the Ancestors\|Preserve of the Ancestors]]. Yet it was undiminished in its grandeur, waiting for its inheritors to reawaken its power for a new era.

Many believe that the full potential of the Radiant Citadel can be unlocked only when the twelve missing civilisations are found and their representatives join the [[Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]].
## Life in the Citadel
The Radiant Citadel is a city of immigrants. Several of the explorers who reclaimed the Citadel were refugees who escaped hardships that plagued their lands. They chose the Citadel as their home, despite its strangeness and the surreal surroundings of the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]], as it presented an opportunity to start anew. Most of the city's current inhabitants are descendants of the founding civilisations active in the Citadel, but all are welcome.

Some find living in the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]] too disquieting to stay or chafe at the confines of the Citadel. Others depart out of fear that the [[Keening Gloom\|Keening Gloom]] will destroy the Citadel. Their numbers are replenished by new arrivals who seek a different life, want to study the city's lore, or find solace in the city's peace and safety. The Citadel's society is shaped by this ebb and flow. Traditions, customs, and values are a mix of old and new; while some adhere to rituals no longer followed in their homeland, others create their own novel practices.

### Governance
The Radiant Citadel is governed by a council known as the [[Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]]. Each Speaker is a descendant of one of the founding civilisations currently known to the Citadel.

### Society
Denizens of the Radiant Citadel strive to sustain an egalitarian society. Every citizen is entitled to a basic income that affords them the necessities of living and dignity in lifestyle. Food, water, and green spaces are equally accessible throughout the city. The [[House of Convalescence\|House of Convalescence]] turns no one away; healing is priced according to one's means, and the poorest are served without charge. All housing is public, distributed, and administered through the city's councils.

### Tariffs and Taxation
Taxes are progressive to help reduce the gap between the most affluent and the poorest. High tariffs on imports keep the public coffers full, but the Speakers lower or remove tariffs for civilisations in trouble. Similarly, visitors to the Radiant Citadel pay a toll to enter.

## Noteworthy Sites
### The Auroral Diamond
The [[Auroral Diamond\|Auroral Diamond]] is the heart of the Radiant Citadel. A massive gemstone of unfathomable power, its life-giving magic runs through the entire city; the city's vegetation, water, light, and unique artifices depend on the Diamond.

### Concord Jewels
Beyond the Radiant Citadel drift the [[Concord Jewels\|Concord Jewels]], which connect the city to its founding civilisations. Each Jewel is a building-sized vessel capable of holding hundreds of people and tons of goods. Though the Jewels take a variety of shapes, their interiors are similar. A cylindrical core holds containers for goods, including livestock. Surrounding the core is seating for passengers. The Citadel employs official operators called [[Clavigers\|Clavigers]] to pilot the Jewels.

Each Concord Jewel is linked to one of the civilisations that founded the Radiant Citadel. A Jewel unerringly travels between the Radiant Citadel and the homeland of the Jewel's linked people. While not in use, the [[Concord Jewels\|Concord Jewels]] orbit the Radiant Citadel in an incandescent constellation.

### The Keening Gloom
Just beyond the light of the Radiant Citadel rages the [[Keening Gloom\|Keening Gloom]], a massive ethereal cyclone. Nothing that enters the cyclone is seen again. 

Scholars have studied the [[Keening Gloom\|Keening Gloom]] for decades but have only theories about its nature, its connection to the Radiant Citadel, and what befalls those caught in its terrible throes. Many fear the cyclone cannot be held at bay forever.

## Groups of the Citadel
Several groups hold influence within the Radiant Citadel, guiding and protecting the city's peoples.

### Incarnates
The keepers of vast wisdom from distant lands, the Incarnates are collections of spirits bound within gemstones. Each of an Incarnate's component gemstones holds a spirit from the same land on the Material Plane. 

The largest and most influential are those of the founding civilisations collectively known as the [[Dawn Incarnates\|Dawn Incarnates]]. 

### Speakers for the Ancestors
The [[Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]] are the ruling body of the Radiant Citadel. Candidates are chosen through an election among the diaspora of the people they represent.

The Speakers' first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel's policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilizations or otherwise. However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources.

### Shieldbearers
Headquartered in the [[Factions & Organisations/Palace of Exile\|Palace of Exile]], the [[Shieldbearers\|Shieldbearers]] have led the Radiant Citadel's rescue and relocation missions. Typically organised in cohorts of four to six members, they are deployed to lands in crisis. Strict rules of engagement prevent them from impacting local conditions or taking sides in a conflict; their mandate allows them only to extract those in danger and defend themselves if attacked. They are among the bravest of the Citadel, and heroes who die in service to the [[Shieldbearers\|Shieldbearers]] receive the city's highest honours.

## Entering the Citadel
Most visitors come to the city by passage on one of the [[Concord Jewels\|Concord Jewels]]. However, it's possible to find the Citadel through exploration of the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]]. The [[Auroral Diamond\|Auroral Diamond]] acts like a beacon for the lost and hopeless, and many who seek the Radiant Citadel within the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]] find their way there within a few days of searching.

## Characters from the Radiant Citadel 
If players want to create characters that are denizens of the Radiant Citadel, ask them the following questions: 

**How did you become a denizen of the Radiant Citadel?** Were you born in the Citadel or somewhere else? If born in the Citadel, what Civilisation/s are your ancestors from? If born somewhere else, where were you born and why did you move to the Citadel?

**What is your opinion on the the Citadel's equiltarian stance?** Do you support or oppose any measures for equality from the Speakers or other Groups? Do you think those measures are sufficient?

**What mystery, if any, of the Radiant Citadel interests you the most?** Do you want to find the Lost Civilisations? Does the lost ancient history of the Radiant Citadel interest you? Do you fear the Keening Gloom?
