Chandos is a large water world with thousands of floating islands that often collide with one another, making these locations less than ideal for permanent settlements. Beneath the islands, in the depths of Chandos, live all sorts of bioluminescent aquatic creatures.

## Locations
[[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] and [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]] are located in Chandos.
