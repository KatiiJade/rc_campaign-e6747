**Nerath**, also known to its inhabitants as "**The First Work**", was a world that existed in a different continuum, parallel to that of [[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]].

The world of Nerath was located in the same [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Prime Material Plane]] where the world of [[Atlas/Worlds/Abeir\|Abeir]]-Toril, among others, existed, but was separated from it by a unthinkably long distance. While it was possible to reach Nerath by traveling beyond the known regions of the Astral Plane or the Elemental Chaos, such a travel would take many long years and it was easier just to find a portal that connected both worlds.

## Locations
[[Atlas/Civilisations/Yongjing\|Yongjing]] is located in Nerath.
