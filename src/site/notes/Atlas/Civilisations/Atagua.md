Much of Atagua consists of grasslands, wetlands, and narrow stretches of tropical forests bordering the [[Holroro River\|Holroro River]]. Two extreme seasons each year of intense rain and dusty drought have shaped this land and blessed its people with resilience. They live, work, and tell stories in villages built on platforms or in sprawling hacienda estates surrounded by sugarcane fields or cacao orchards. Though their villages might be separated by many miles, Ataguans meet each other in their dreams due to the connections between this land and a mystical mountain in the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]].

For nearly two hundred years, the people of Atagua have thrived, peacefully trading among diverse outposts connected by the [[Grassroads\|Grassroads]]—a system of walkways elevated to protect from floods, fires, and other threats and engineered by the ancient [[Flood People\|Flood People]] who first settled these lands. Yet danger remains. In some years, the rains that end the dry season are late, increasing the risk of wildfires. [[Bulettes\|Bulettes]] and other predators shadow travellers on the [[Grassroads\|Grassroads]] or stalk the [[thri-kreen\|thri-kreen]] folk who wander the [[Llanos\|Llanos]]. And among the [[Green Doctors\|Green Doctors]], a guild of healers and scholars, old tales warn of strange whistling creatures that sometimes pass into Atagua from dark realms—and that might someday emerge in unstoppable numbers to consume this land.

## Features
Those familiar with Atagua know the following details: 
**Hallmarks.** This land is known for the chocolate and sugar produced there and for the elevated walkways that traverse its forests and tropical savannas. Folk there experience vivid dreams, often of an invisible, flat-topped mountain. 
**People of Atagua.** Ataguans are predominantly humans and forest gnomes with tan to dark-brown complexions, along with smaller numbers of tabaxi and tieflings, the latter of whom typically bear three horns. Nomadic clans of thri-kreen with iridescent carapaces also wander the Llanos; they're rarely encountered in towns and cities.
**Languages.** Quirapu is the language of Atagua, a melded derivative of the original languages of the Flood People who first settled these lands and the colonizers who came after them. All folk of Atagua also speak Common. 

## Legends of Atagua
Ataguans dream vividly of a great tepui—a tabletop mountain surrounded by jungle. Though the site is unseen and unreachable, many claim the shared experience of having explored the mesa in their dreams, seeing others like themselves in passing, and meeting otherworldly beings.

The secret behind these dreams is found in the oldest legends, which speak of the [[Ghost Orchid Tepui\|Ghost Orchid Tepui]] existing simultaneously in the [[Llanos\|Llanos]] and in the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]], parallel to Atagua. The source of the dreams is a powerful crystal called the [[Sleeping Stone\|Sleeping Stone]], which many who dream have seen, alongside magical white orchids growing in the crystalline caverns below the tepui's summit.

As counterpoint to these bright dreams, sinister creatures haunt the history of Atagua. During the [[war of independence\|war of independence]], rattling whistles rose from the [[Llanos\|Llanos]] at night. As the fighting increased, the whistling manifested near villages and haciendas, inspiring nightmares or incurable despair for those who survived hearing it. Some reported seeing hunched giants from the corner of the eye—a new threat to terrorize a war-weary people.

When the fighting ended and Atagua was free once more, the nightmares ended. The menacing whistlers were largely forgotten as the peoples of Atagua embraced peace and reconstruction. But even today, whistlers occasionally appear in the [[Llanos\|Llanos]], evidence that the Far Realm still influences the land. And some among the [[Green Doctors\|Green Doctors]] whisper that Atagua might yet face an invasion by those terrors.

## Noteworthy Sites
Atagua is a rugged country of tropical grassland plains and gallery forests—a great savanna known locally as the [[Llanos\|Llanos]]. Spread across the basin of the twisting [[Holroro River\|Holroro River]], the peoples of this land dwell in scattered outposts connected by walkways called the [[Grassroads\|Grassroads]].

### The Grassroads
The [[Grassroads\|Grassroads]] are a system of elevated, 15-foot-wide roads ranging from 5 to 20 feet in height and punctuated by lean-to shelters; the roads and shelters alike are constructed from wood, reeds, and stone. The folk of Atagua use these roads to ensure safe passage above the many hazards of the [[Llanos\|Llanos]]. Traders and farmers walk the roads day and night, protected by the elite fighter-scouts known as [[Cababa\|Cababa]] warriors, who patrol constantly for poachers and bandits. [[Thri-kreen\|Thri-kreen]] can often be found scavenging the ground beneath the pathways for items dropped from above. They then trade these items for [[panela\|panela]]—cones of brown sugar cooked in mills across Atagua.

### El Caparazón
Hundreds of farming villages dot the Llanos, bordered by sugarcane fields and orchards of cacao trees. [[El Caparazón\|El Caparazón]] ("The Shell") is the largest of these settlements and the capital of Atagua. It was named for a latticework partial dome built by the [[Flood People\|Flood People]] hundreds of years ago. 

The dome provides precious shade to the central square known as the [[Mercado Sucre\|Mercado Sucre]] and to a grand hacienda roofed with amber-hued tiles. Called the [[Sugar Alcázar\|Sugar Alcázar]], this hacienda is home to [[Alfonz Rubinaz-Zumdi\|Alfonz Rubinaz-Zumdi]], the powerful landowner known as the Sugar Man.

About 5 miles outside the city, [[Port Panela\|Port Panela]] serves as Atagua's port. It boasts dozens of wooden docks as well as thatched huts on stilted platforms, and the harbor teems with sleek trade boats returning or departing with sugar, cacao, goods, and travelers.

### The Outposts
Three remote settlements, collectively known as "[[the outposts\|the outposts]]," are home to the most notable factions of Atagua. One is a busy encampment that serves as a base for the [[Tribe of Builders\|Tribe of Builders]], the engineers and workers who repair and extend the [[Grassroads\|Grassroads]]. Every six years they rebuild this encampment, which they affectionately call the [[Devil's Hammock\|Devil's Hammock]]. The second outpost was once the [[El Chapán\|El Chapán]] rum distillery; after it closed down long ago, it became a trading post for the [[thri-kreen\|thri-kreen]] of the [[Llanos\|Llanos]]. The third outpost is the [[Silver Tapir Monastery\|Silver Tapir Monastery]], which serves as the sanctuary and school of the [[Green Doctors\|Green Doctors]].

## Life in Atagua
Those who live in Atagua or travel through the Llanos are shaped by the following truths.

### Hard-Won Independence
Nearly five hundred years ago, an invading force rolled across the [[Llanos\|Llanos]] of Atagua, thereafter invading the neighbouring region of [[Atlas/Civilisations/San Citlán\|San Citlán]]. But after three centuries of occupation, the mixed descendants of the [[Flood People\|Flood People]] who first settled Atagua and former invaders who made peace with them decisively expelled their would-be rulers after a thirteen-year war of independence. Atagua's people are the result of the multigenerational intermingling between the native [[Flood People\|Flood People]], the descendants of invaders who rebelled against their leaders and settled here, and a steady stream of new immigrants and adventurers drawn to the freedom and challenges of life on the [[Llanos\|Llanos]].

The aftermath of war was marked by a vibrant rebuilding period. Large settlements such as [[El Caparazón\|El Caparazón]] retained some of the cultural aspects of the long colonial occupation, while rural villages primarily drew on the legacy of the [[Flood People\|Flood People]].

Even after two centuries of peace, tensions sometimes arise between clans and factions due to feuds and the revival of ancient grudges. These conflicts flare but are resolved through hard work, patient negotiations, and compromises by all sides. Overall, the people of Atagua embrace the idea that they form a complicated, diverse culture—and that together, they will shape a hopeful future.

### Lives of the People
Sugar and chocolate are abundant in the cuisine of Atagua, especially in the favoured beverages: drinking chocolate, strong coffee, and even stronger rum sweetened with panela—the cooked-down juice of sugarcane. Corn, black beans, and plantains are the cornerstones of every meal, and arepas—grilled buns made from ground corn—are eaten by the wealthy and the poor alike.

The folk of this land work hard by day, but they mark each noon as the start of the siesta, which offers a much-needed respite from the midday heat. People retire to the shade of haciendas or huts, to rest or quietly gather with their closest kin, for it is said that only the untrustworthy conduct their affairs under the blistering midday sun. And when work is done, evenings explode with social activity and music.

Cropped cotton trousers, long-sleeve tunics, long and loose sleeveless jackets known as gilets, full skirts, and straw hats are everyday dress for people of all genders in Atagua. Geometric tattoos or angular designs painted with butterfly-based pigments are commonplace on faces and hands. And the [[Cababa\|Cababa]] warriors and the workers of the [[Tribe of Builders\|Tribe of Builders]] bear accessories made from feathers and flowers, paired with snakeskin kilts.

### Faith and Fortune
Religion in Atagua revolves around the [[Suwa\|Suwa]], a shifting pantheon of hundreds of folk heroes. Small, colourful statues of [[Suwa\|Suwa]] heroes are found everywhere in Atagua and are honoured with offerings of rum or sweets. Ataguans are tolerant of different beliefs and often adopt legendary figures from other cultures into the [[Suwa\|Suwa]].

### The Green Doctors
The collective of mystics known as the [[Green Doctors\|Green Doctors]] weaves together knowledge of magic and herbal medicine to heal the people and creatures of Atagua. The leader of their order is an elf named [[Melecio\|Melecio]]. [[Green Doctors\|Green Doctors]] are recognized by the green sash they wear around their waists, but any healer, mage, or storyteller can study medicine at the order's home, the [[Silver Tapir Monastery\|Silver Tapir Monastery]].
