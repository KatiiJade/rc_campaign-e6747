Toril is a vast and wondrous world, filled with an immense diversity of peoples and a rich, full history. For most folk of the Sword Coast, however, knowledge doesn’t extend much beyond the confines of the North, and anything “known” outside of Faerûn proper is based more in rumor than in fact.

Toril, the locale of the Forgotten Realms setting, is the most populous world in [[Atlas/Wildspaces/Realmspace\|Realmspace]] and home to some of the most powerful individuals in this system. It has regular and prosperous ties with the various nations and factions of Wildspace.

Toril's single large moon, [[Atlas/Worlds/Selûne (Moon)\|Selûne (Moon)]], has a breathable atmosphere and is occupied by isolated groups of inhabitants. Toril's space-dwelling communities generally congregate in a cluster of asteroids that trails behind [[Atlas/Worlds/Selûne (Moon)\|Selûne (Moon)]] in the same orbit. This cluster, called the Tears of Selûne, has numerous settlements. The Rock of Bral (described in the _Astral Adventurer's Guide_) could be one of the many asteroids that form the cluster.
