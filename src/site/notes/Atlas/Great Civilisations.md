The Civilisations from the **Journeys through the Radiant Citadel** anthology book, are inspired by various real world cultures and mythologies. The book provides information on each great civilisation, but there are no specific player sections. I have cumulated the information for each Civilisation on their own page.

## Cultural Notes
Whilst the Civilisations are inspired by real world cultures and societies, please try to avoid stereotypes and be respectful.

Each Civilisation lists typical population details including species and appearances. These are a guidelines and you do not need to stick to it for your Character creation if you are not comfortable or do not wish too. I plan on NPCs following these guides in respect to the writers, but will avoid portraying the NPCs in stereotypical ways.

## Locations
The Civilisations are located across many different planes and worlds. Please note that some of these worlds are from previous editions of DND, partnered, and third party material. The Civilisations are either new on these maps or replace existing locations. Some lore for these worlds may be changed to accommodate the Civilisation in that area.

The Lost Civilisations could be from any location through out the [[Atlas/Multiverse\|Multiverse]].
