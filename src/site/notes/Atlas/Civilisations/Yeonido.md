The people of Yeonido, the City of Judgment, pride themselves on upholding tradition. Thousands of years ago, the great dragon [[Mireu\|Mireu]] entrusted the founders of the city-state with a mandate to forge and lead a great civilisation. Yeonido's people took the dragon's words to heart, establishing a reverence for fealty and order that has remained steadfast through the centuries. Two main beliefs form the foundation of Yeonido society: that structure is key to all things, and that adherence to familial duty trumps all but one's devotion to the royal family. 

But those noble traditions have a troubling side: the disquieting ancestral spirits called [[gwishin\|gwishin]] that refuse to leave the world behind. When a citizen of Yeonido dies feeling wronged or knowing that they've harmed others, they return as one of these spirits. It's up to the spirit's family to resolve the injustice and bring peace to the [[gwishin\|gwishin]], allowing it to move onward. If a [[gwishin\|gwishin]] is allowed to endure, it grows ever more dangerous. 

In recent years, some in Yeonido have begun to challenge the cultural reverence for ancient traditions, creating unease and discord. It may be no coincidence that [[gwishin\|gwishin]] are appearing more frequently than ever before, but it's unclear if more citizens are dying with unfinished business or if something more sinister is at work. Some even believe that the royal family has lost the trust of the great dragon [[Mireu\|Mireu]]. Everyone has an opinion, but no one knows how to restore harmony in Yeonido. 

## Pronunciation

**Languages.** The city's official language is Halri, a language related to Draconic, though all citizens are also fluent in Common. 

## Legends of Yeonido
According to the oldest tales, the [[Dokkaebi Mountains\|Dokkaebi Mountains]] rose above a world shrouded in mist. All lands were bleak and terrifying in those days, cloaked in endless darkness. Those who had hope in their hearts set their sights on the [[Dokkaebi Mountains\|Dokkaebi Mountains]] and traveled to the foothills, praying that something would save them.

Three great dragon siblings saw the penumbral world and descended from the heavens. The dragon [[Mireu\|Mireu]] gave the mortals at the [[Dokkaebi Mountains\|Dokkaebi Mountains]] a divine gift—a pearl infused with the dragon's own heavenly power, which drove back the mist. [[Mireu\|Mireu]]'s people formed the city of Yeonido, while the other two dragons established the lands of Xing ([[Atlas/Civilisations/Yongjing\|Yongjing]]) and [[Atlas/Civilisations/Umizu\|Umizu]]. Tales say that the [[Seat of Dragons\|Seat of Dragons]] in Yeonido is still home to [[Mireu\|Mireu]]'s pearl, proof of the city's divine origins. However, if the pearl exists, its location is a secret fiercely guarded by the royal family.

The story of Yeonido's origins is often accompanied by the cautionary tale of the first [[gwishin\|gwishin]]. Her name has since been stricken from all records, but she was the sister of a king. Jealousy grew in her heart, and she raised her hand against her sibling. For this crime, she was struck down by [[Mireu\|Mireu]], and a sickly monster appeared in her place.

## Noteworthy Sites
The city-state of Yeonido is nestled among fertile hills and deep forests. Though many dangerous beasts dwell in those lands, farming villages surround the walled city of Yeonido itself, supporting the city and benefiting from its protection.

### The Seat of Dragons
In the centre of Yeonido stands the [[Seat of Dragons\|Seat of Dragons]], the palace that houses the royal family and government. The outer palace walls are a brilliant red, and the drawbridge over the moat is always open to allow citizens to enter. Important ceremonies take place in the castle courtyard, where [[Queen Jin-Mi\|Queen Jin-Mi]] can often be seen greeting her people.

Though the [[Seat of Dragons\|Seat of Dragons]] has no magical wards protecting it, [[gwishin\|gwishin]] never enter the palace grounds. Some speculate that this is because the [[Pearl of Mireu\|Pearl of Mireu]]—a legendary gift the draconic founder of Yeonido granted to its people—is hidden somewhere in the palace.

### Yu-Ik River
The [[Yu-Ik River\|Yu-Ik River]] flows just outside Yeonido's walls and is an essential part of the city. The riverbank holds a bright community of market stalls, colourful art, traders, peddlers, tinkers, and vendors of food and drink. On official holidays, people gather along the riverbank to tie ribbons on tree branches, play games along the shore, and celebrate with good food. However, these gatherings sometimes turn ugly, with fights breaking out due to muggings and territorial disputes arising among merchants. Cautious vendors often hire guards to protect them from trouble.

### [[Dokkaebi Temple\|Dokkaebi Temple]]
Not far from the city, this cursed temple sits on a cliff above a majestic waterfall. Foolhardy children dare each other to spend the night within the forbidding temple—a challenge that has sometimes proven fatal. The temple is brilliantly painted with a thousand colours and marked with hundreds of spiritual seals. Although the site is rumoured to be filled with treasures, only the most reckless thieves consider breaking in, for countless [[gwishin\|gwishin]] rage there each night, their screams echoing for miles.

## Life in Yeonido
The people of Yeonido are proud of their traditions and welcoming to those who respect their ways.

### Structured Society
Yeonido's residents believe in sacrifice for the good of the community. One must work selflessly, listen to one's elders, and act according to one's status for Yeonido to prosper. Structure is the central pillar of society. Class structure and family structure are key components of life within the city. Change is possible, but usually only when it's driven by members of the royal family or the noble clans. [[Queen Jin-Mi\|Queen Jin-Mi]] sits at the apex of the social order, followed by the noble elite, the various ranks of government magistrates, and the heads of each familial clan.

### Clans and Identity
Clans live in compounds that often hold every member of the family, organised with its own hierarchy and led by a designated elder. But clans extend beyond families, often adopting outsiders who take up permanent residence in the city-state. When people meet, they exchange clan information before personal details, and the few folk in the city who have no clan—whether they were ejected from a clan or never adopted into one—are viewed with sympathy.

When people marry—whether for love or for social or political reasons, both of which are considered equally valid—they must choose which partner's clan they will belong to after the union. In rare cases, a new couple decides to establish their own clan, though they often face judgment from their birth clans.

### Rule by Magistrates
The city-state of Yeonido is ruled by the beloved [[Queen Jin-Mi\|Queen Jin-Mi]], a dragonborn said to be descended from the city's founder and first ruler, the dragon [[Mireu\|Mireu]]. The bureaucracy surrounding her consists of officials known as magistrates, who govern the city-state and enforce its laws. Those who aspire to become magistrates must undergo the exams—known collectively as the [[Test of Ascension\|Test of Ascension]]—that take place each spring. These tests are notoriously difficult, and typically only those wealthy enough to afford time to study and special tutoring pass. Still, many less affluent but dedicated students have used this path to change their social status. Even non-citizens are allowed to take the test if they show proper respect for the process.

### Spirit Arbiter
Magistrates called [[spirit arbiters\|spirit arbiters]] specialize in bringing an end—peaceful or otherwise—to rogue [[gwishin\|gwishin]]. They investigate the appearance of these spirits, soothe them, and then attempt to right the wrongs that hold them in the world. If left with no recourse, [[spirit arbiters\|spirit arbiters]] destroy [[gwishin\|gwishin]], but they seek to avoid doing so. These somber magistrates are known for the traditional, broad-brimmed black hat, called a gat, that they each wear as part of their uniform.

## Characters from Yeonido
If players create characters from Yeonido, ask them the following questions:

**What is your social class and clan?** Is your family part of the nobility or the working class? Do you want to change your status? Are you an active member of your clan or have you left it behind?
**Do you have a special role in the city's hierarchies?** Are you a member of the royalty? Did you or do you hope to pass the Test of Ascension and become a magistrate? Are you an arbiter who deals with spirits?
**How have gwishin affected you?** Did a member of your family return as a gwishin? Did your family deal with their own gwishin, call aid in dealing with it, or let it linger? Did a gwishin of another clan teach, harm, or otherwise interact with you?

### Names
Family comes first in Yeonido, and thus an individual's clan name is spoken before their given name. The royal family is an exception—they have no clan name, since it is expected that everyone should know them at first glance.

Given names in Yeonido typically have two syllables. Within each clan, siblings and cousins of the same generation often share one syllable of their name. For example, a couple might have a son named Ji-Min and a daughter named Ji-Yun. The head of the clan chooses each new child's name. The following are examples of common Yeonido names:

**Clan Names.** Bae, Chun, Ha, Ju, Seong
**Feminine.** Gyung-Won, Hana, Ji-Yun, Su-Min, Yun-Hi
**Masculine.** Do-Won, Gang-Min, Habin, Ji-Min, Oh-Seung
**Gender-Neutral.** Haneul, Han-Sol, Ji-Su, Si-Won, Yu-Min
