[[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]]'s single large moon, Selûne (Moon), has a breathable atmosphere and is occupied by isolated groups of inhabitants. [[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]]'s space-dwelling communities generally congregate in a cluster of asteroids that trails behind Selûne (Moon) in the same orbit. This cluster, called the Tears of Selûne, has numerous settlements. The Rock of Bral (described in the _Astral Adventurer's Guide_) could be one of the many asteroids that form the cluster.

## Locations
[[Atlas/Civilisations/Shankhabhumi\|Shankhabhumi]] is located on Selûne (Moon) that is [[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]]'s moon.
