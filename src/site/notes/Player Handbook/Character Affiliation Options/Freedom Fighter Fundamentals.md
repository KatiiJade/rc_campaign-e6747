This smithy is run by [[Citali Gallegos\|Citali Gallegos]], a bright-eyed metalworker from [[Atlas/Civilisations/San Citlán\|San Citlán]]. She occupies a spacious shop at the very bottom of the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]], and is assisted in all her work by her magical Unseen Servant and her giant red bull, [[Paz\|Paz]] (at least, Paz thinks he's assisting). She retired from the front lines of the revolution some time ago, and now makes her living supplying freedom fighters in all the various Radiant Citadel Civilisations. She also has a collection of Revolutionary books (tactics and the histories of various revolutions). 

Almost nothing is available to purchase on the day, because she is highly sought after and booked up in advance. However if you are a freedom fighter or assisting in a cause she knows, she has emergency supplies available at excellent prices.
