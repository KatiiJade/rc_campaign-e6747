For any first-time visitor to the archipelago of Dayawlongon, the [[skybridges\|skybridges]] are a stunning sight. Both roadways and refuges, with whole communities dwelling along some of the miles-long spans, these structures were built centuries ago with the help of great [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]]—massive, serpentine dragons endemic to Dayawlongon's five main islands and dozens of smaller islands, which were much larger than the [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] that remain. The [[skybridges\|skybridges]] are the safest way to travel between many islands, high above the whirlpools that churn in the sea below. However, centuries of conflict have taken their toll on those structures; the great [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] whose bones and magic infuse them are long gone; and the artisan-warriors who maintain the bridges, known as [[bonesingers\|bonesingers]], are disappearing from history.

Dayawlongon has survived battles between its resident clans and the incursions of five foreign powers, and it has been independent and largely at peace for the last two centuries. In ages past, [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] served as mediators and defenders of the islands, but successive waves of invasion targeted the creatures, drastically reducing their numbers. Today, the islands' residents fiercely defend their home and seek to honour the history stolen by centuries of war.

## Features
Those familiar with the Dayawlongon archipelago know the following details: 
**Hallmarks.** The archipelago is known for the gigantic skybridges and sacred trees that tower over the islands. Serpentine Dragons called bakunawa, now rare, once defended the islands, and their bones and magic are infused into the skybridges. 
**People.** Most Dayawlongos are human, with dark hair and brown skin. Eyes of yellow, green, or brown are most common. Dragonborn and tieflings are also indigenous to the archipelago; many Dayawlongo dragonborn have iridescent scales and serpentine features, and many tieflings have iridescent feathers. 
**Languages.** Most folk in Dayawlongon speak Common and Snakesong, a dialect of Draconic that tales say was taught to the locals by bakunawa. 

## Legends of Dayawlongon
Ancient belief states that all life on Dayawlongon is born from the spoken words of a poet goddess—known as [[Kamatayang-Langit\|Kamatayang-Langit]]—from which comes the people's deep reverence for poetry and song. This is why every community has one or more [[binukots\|binukots]], bards who serve as living repositories of art, culture, custom, and law. The death of a [[binukot\|binukot]] can result in the loss of generations of history, as Dayawlongo tradition eschews writing stories or songs down. [[Bonesingers\|Bonesingers]] maintain that [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] are among the greatest [[binukots\|binukots]], their vast memories making them bearers of ancient truths.

## Noteworthy Sites
Dayawlongon is a tropical archipelago whose waters hold massive whirlpools that make boat travel between the islands challenging. Winding rivers, deep jungles, and mountains define its five major islands.

### Kalapang
[[Kalapang\|Kalapang]], the largest community on the island of [[Malabulak\|Malabulak]], stands among verdant fields. The city is a blend of old and new, with ancient religious sites and relics of foreign rule constructed alongside newer structures built by traders and immigrants looking for security. [[Kalapang\|Kalapang]] is welcoming toward foreigners and encourages visitors. Powerful clans and the mercantile ventures regularly hire adventurers for trade excursions and exploration—such as journeys to the island of [[Lambakluha\|Lambakluha]].

### Lambakluha
The island of [[Lambakluha\|Lambakluha]] is known as the "Vale of Tears" in Snakesong. It was once the holiest place in Dayawlongon, home to [[Bathalang Puno\|Bathalang Puno]], a temple city nestled within the roots of a colossal banyan tree that shared the city's name. That great tree was said to be where islanders' souls went after death. Some of these souls transcended into [[ninunos\|ninunos]]—dryad-like spirits of the land who serve as stewards to the gods and resided in the surrounding lands. Colonising invaders burned the great tree and razed [[Bathalang Puno\|Bathalang Puno]], killing untold people and spirits alike. In the aftermath, [[Lambakluha\|Lambakluha]] became a cursed place, where spirits seethe in the land, spreading corruption across the island.

Decades ago, an expedition from [[Kalapang\|Kalapang]] set up a camp on the island called the [[Final Steps of Courage\|Final Steps of Courage]], hoping to exorcise the land's tormented spirits. Thus far, these soldiers and scholars have made little progress toward their goal.

### Skybridges
A gift from [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] to the first folk of the archipelago, the [[skybridges\|skybridges]] of Dayawlongon are magical feats of architecture that connect many of the region's islands. Travelers are common, and the most travelled skybridges hold small communities where they can rest and resupply. Legend holds that the bones of enormous [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] were infused into the [[skybridges\|skybridges]] in ages past, with the creatures' blessing. Only [[bonesingers\|bonesingers]], people chosen as stewards of the skybridges, know how to maintain the magic that keeps the [[skybridges\|skybridges]] safe.

## Life in Dayawlongon
Several truths shape life on the Dayawlongon archipelago; some are deeply rooted traditions, and others have been moulded by foreign influences.

### Ancestral Strength
Reverence toward one's ancestors is deeply ingrained in Dayawlongo society, where a passion for the past is demonstrated by people's love for oaths, poetry, and song. Ancestors sometimes return as guardians called [[ninunos\|ninunos]], spirits of the dead who have taken on new, dryad-like forms and serve as intercessors between mortals, the gods, and the land. [[Ninunos\|Ninunos]] watch over their bloodlines, bestowing good fortune on pious descendants or curses upon those who put their own needs over those of the family and broader community.

### Bonesingers
Artisan-warriors, [[bonesingers\|bonesingers]] dedicate their lives to maintaining the skybridges. In the ancient past, [[bonesingers\|bonesingers]] oversaw the final rites when great [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] died, then infused the creatures' bones into the magical bridges that unite Dayawlongon as one land. During the days of the first colonial incursions, [[bonesingers\|bonesingers]] became Dayawlongon's earliest freedom fighters, but their victories came at a great cost. Many [[skybridges\|skybridges]] became battlegrounds, and countless allied [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] were lost. Today, the gigantic [[bakunawa\|bakunawa]] of old are gone, and few of their smaller descendants remain. The loss of these great creatures and their magic prevents the creation of new [[skybridges\|skybridges]].

### Clans and Reputation
Dozens of clans unite families across the Dayawlongon archipelago. Marriages are unions of clans as much as unions between individuals. Adoptions, polyamorous relationships, and other generous family bonds create varied ways to join different clans. Clans have few proscribed roles for their members, with each group sharing responsibilities in ways that work for their members.

Reputation carries great value in Dayawlongon, and a person's reputation also shapes that of their loved ones in the eyes of peers. A Dayawlongo treats their best friend's children like their own offspring and curses the names of their enemy's family.

### Debt of the Soul
One of the cornerstones of Dayawlongo culture is the concept of [[utang ng loob\|utang ng loob]], a debt of the soul. If someone saves another from mortal peril or assists another at great cost to themself, a soul debt is formed between the people in question and their bloodlines. This debt holds throughout any number of generations until it is repaid. Failing to respect a soul debt is the deepest form of betrayal for Dayawlongos and the root of countless blood feuds.

## Characters from Dayawlongon
If players want to create characters from the Dayawlongon archipelago, ask them the following questions:

**What stories can you tell about yourself?** Has a ninuno ever spoken to you? Is a particular song, poem, or tale the binukots tell your favorite? What stories do you want others to tell about you after your death?
**What do you think of bakunawa?** Does a bakunawa feature in your family's history? Do you believe bakunawa are creatures to be revered or monsters?
**Are you trained as a binukot?** Do you collect the stories of your people? Do you want to broaden your peoples' knowledge by collecting stories from distant lands and sharing them at home?

### Names
Traditionally, Dayawlongos have a personal name followed by a clan name. Personal names are varied and often reflect a characteristic that a ninuno connected to an individual or their family found desirable. However, some personal names are relics of colonization and have foreign origins. The following names are common in Dayawlongo:

**Feminine.** Asterio, Corazón, Flordeliza, Modesta, Sinta
**Masculine.** Amado, Estanislao, Gio, Joaquin, Mirikit
**Gender-Neutral.** Alon, Bulan, Dalisay, Melchor
**Clan Names.** Bahaghari, Dimansalang, Fabion, Posadas, Recio
