**Abeir** (pronounced: /ɑːɪbɪər/ _ai-BEER_ or: /ɑːbɪər/ _ah-BEER_ was the twin planet of [[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]] located in the same [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] of its sibling world, but within a "pocket dimension" that was out of synchronicity with Toril. Abeir revolved around the same sun of [[Atlas/Wildspaces/Realmspace\|Realmspace]] , and shared the lunar satellite [[Atlas/Worlds/Selûne (Moon)\|Selûne (Moon)]] and its Tears with [[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]]. The name of this twin planet means life, vitality, the experience of living, and the cycle of life, depending on the words around it.

The known continents of Abeir were [[Atlas/Landmasses/Shyr\|Shyr]], Marranth, Irronther, and Laerakond (at least before it was transferred to Toril), as well as a few archipelagos such as the Cold Strait, the Ice Run, and the Khannath; and a region of which little was known, Lhoraun. Among the known bodies of water of Abeir were the Andol Sea, the Arserpent Sea, the Boiling Sea, the Dun Seas, the Frozen Seas, and the Oshlar Sea.

Like Toril, it also contained an Underdark (known as the Nardark to the local inhabitants).

For a time, Maztica was also part of this world as a consequence of the Spellplague, but this landmass was returned to Toril during the Second Sundering.
