From the turquoise spires of this holy city-state's oldest temple, a radiant angel watches over Akharin Sangar. His name is [[Atash\|Atash]]. For many, his presence is a source of comfort: a promise of protection and guidance. But a growing proportion of Sangarians find his rule suffocating. The angel's word is law, his doctrine rigid, and his enforcement absolute.

Akharin Sangar is a vibrant city-state with a deep appreciation for art and tradition. It rests on a plateau beneath the [[Heavenly Peaks\|Heavenly Peaks]], a bulwark of rugged, mountains that have protected their lands for centuries. Though most inhabitants reside in the city or the surrounding hills, more stalwart folk brave the [[Burning Dunes\|Burning Dunes]], where draconic scavengers scour the ruins of old civilizations and rocs soar over adobe settlements like massive vultures.

Akharin Sangar has all but closed its gates to the rest of the world. Outsiders often surmise the city-state is full of zealots as severe as the city's angel ruler. In truth, Sangarians are a friendly, hospitable people, eager to share their traditions with visitors and unhappy with Atash's embargoes and nightly curfew. A fellowship of artisans, philosophers, and merchants has formed a secret coalition known as the [[Silent Roar\|Silent Roar]] that seeks to oust [[Atash\|Atash]] and revive the city by instituting rule by the people. Meanwhile, pernicious anarchists called the [[Ashen Heirs\|Ashen Heirs]] foment unrest, striving for change at any cost.

## Legends of Akharin Sangar
Akharin Sangar's most famous historical tale is an epic poem about its heroic founder, [[Piruzan\|Piruzan]]. When [[Piruzan\|Piruzan]]'s people were tormented by the horned demon [[Zolmate Shab\|Zolmate Shab]], she led them up the [[Heavenly Peaks\|Heavenly Peaks]] in search of a land free from tyranny and darkness. The demon intercepted them at the summit, appearing in a pillar of smoke. Emboldened by the coming dawn, the first Sangarians prepared to make a last stand. With the power of the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]], [[Piruzan\|Piruzan]] banished the relentless demon. She became queen of this new land and ruled for over three hundred years, never forgetting the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]]'s warmth.

Akharin Sangar flourished during the dynasties that followed but eventually succumbed to excess, corruption, and complacency. Darkness fell upon the city-state, and [[Zolmate Shab\|Zolmate Shab]] returned. As demons beset the city, Sangarians prayed to the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]], and [[Atash\|Atash]] answered. After an earthshaking battle, the angel emerged victorious.

Afterward, [[Atash\|Atash]] prophesied the return of [[Zolmate Shab\|Zolmate Shab]], even stronger than before, if the people of Akharin Sangar fell from grace again. After fifty years of peace, though, most Sangarians have come to doubt the prophecy's legitimacy, and many question whether the angel's rigid control of the city-state is justified.

## Noteworthy Sites
### Three Sun Square
[[Three Sun Square\|Three Sun Square]] is an important hub whose three architectural marvels exemplify the pillars of local society—religion, government, and economy.

**Avalin Sahar.** The decorative turquoise-and-gold facade of the city-state's oldest temple, [[Avalin Sahar\|Avalin Sahar]], beckons all to kneel in worship of the deity locally known as the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]].

**Noble Jewel.** Members of the [[Brightguard\|Brightguard]], a holy order of protectors and enforcers, call the [[Noble Jewel\|Noble Jewel]]—once the royal palace—their headquarters. Occasionally, [[Atash\|Atash]] appears on the palace's garden terrace to issue a proclamation, much like the rulers who preceded him.

**Ruz Bazaar.** Fragrant spices lure shoppers to the bustling [[Ruz Bazaar\|Ruz Bazaar]], a sprawling complex of vendors that hides an underground market.

### Foothills of the Heavenly Peaks
The hills beneath the [[Heavenly Peaks\|Heavenly Peaks]] are fertile, blessing farmers with bountiful harvests of juicy pomegranates, buttery pistachios, and crimson strands of saffron. Rebellion also flourishes, as the [[Brightguard\|Brightguard]] has a smaller presence here, and the nation's curfew is not enforced. Free thinkers gather at aged teahouses, discussing philosophy as they sip from steaming cups, and acting as secret missionaries who dare to defy angelic law.

### The Sky Prison
Deep within the majestic desert east of Akharin Sangar, the floating edifice of [[Zendaane Sabz\|Zendaane Sabz]], known more commonly as the [[Sky Prison\|Sky Prison]], hangs over a lake of shattered glass. The prison is a crystalline hive peppered with demiplanes of divine judgment. Inside lurk potent evils banished by [[Atash\|Atash]], such as [[Faasadi the Rotten\|Faasadi the Rotten]], an adult blue dracolich, and the ageless [[Chesmare\|Chesmare]], a beholder who can do nothing but admire her own reflection in a mirrored cell that neutralizes her power. Given [[Atash\|Atash]]'s intolerance for misconduct, the prison's population continues to grow, but now it fills with more ordinary folk guilty of lesser crimes.

## Life in Akharin Sangar
Despite the rumors outside its borders, Akharin Sangar is markedly hospitable. By long-standing custom, every Sangarian is a potential host and must be prepared to entertain guests on short notice. Visitors are invited to relax on luxurious carpets adorned with colourful pillows while their host prepares them hot beverages—if not an entire meal.

### Education and Art
A thirst for knowledge permeates Akharin Sangar. Its many independent schools are free to teach broad curricula that beget a well-read populace, although the long list of censored works constrains opportunities for higher education, especially in philosophy and literature. The city-state cautiously embraces progress, adopting developments in magic and science as long as they don't contradict religious principles.

Akharin Sangar has a rich artistic heritage. Architecture is thoughtful and symbolic, and instruments like the barbat and kamancheh sweeten poetic lyrics with their unmistakable tones. Sangarian carpets exemplify the city-state's long history of vibrant textiles: painstakingly woven rugs are highly sought works of art. Some are even rumoured to fly.

### Food and Clothing
Sangarian cuisine emphasizes savory, sweet, and sour flavours. When households entertain guests and during festivals, kabobs and hearty stews infused with saffron grace dinner plates alongside beds of rice. Bakers stay busy, filling bellies with chewy flatbreads and scrumptious pastries tinged with rosewater. But Sangarians know how to stretch small pots of a soup called aash to feed an entire family.

Clothing is generally modest, and Sangarians value fashionable dress. Men's attire consists of baggy trousers, handwoven shoes, and robes or tunics secured with wide cloth belts. Women typically dress in layers, sporting long, elegant skirts and blouses with heavy embroidery. Floral patterns are common regardless of gender, and colors range from vivid to muted depending on preference. Common headwear includes scarves, caps, and headbands with veiled hats.

### Laws and Society
Unprepared visitors might find some aspects of Sangarian society unusually austere. Intoxicants are prohibited within the city, there's a strict curfew after sundown, and everyday interactions are tinged with restraint to steer clear of Atash's forbiddances. Sangarians reserve intimacy for family and close friends, lowering their social guard only in the comfort of their homes.

### The Sunweaver
Most Sangarians revere the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]]—or pretend to. Locally, the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]]'s faith uses an upright torch topped with a blazing sun as its symbol. Activities halt during daily prayers, which take place at dawn, noon, and sundown. Though other faiths are tolerated, those faiths are sequestered in shrines on the city's outskirts. Public preaching is considered taboo, and unauthorized missionary work earns the ire of the [[Brightguard\|Brightguard]].

The [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]] holds ultimate authority in Akharin Sangar, which is a theocracy ruled by the god's self-proclaimed messenger. [[Atash\|Atash]] interprets the [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]]'s doctrine and encourages all citizens to cultivate light and warmth. The [[Sunweaver\|Sunweaver]]'s clerics hold significant power. In addition to priestly duties, they act as government officials and judges, employing divination magic in audits and trials.

Those who break the law answer to the [[Brightguard\|Brightguard]]. The religious order enforces the law without prejudice, though its ranks contain both tender-hearted civil servants and disciplinarians who relish chastising citizens for misdemeanors.
