> |  | The [[Covenant\|Covenant]] gods came together and created Godsbreath |

Generations ago, a land was plundered by enemies whose names are lost to time. Five gods came together to save as many of the land's beleaguered inhabitants as they could by taking them to a new home. Those the gods saved named their new land Godsbreath, in honour of the deities who brought them across a vast sea to a new life. These inhabitants banded together to build strong communities and protect themselves from danger. From one generation to the next, they share stories of their past, of the distant lands of their ancestors, and of the unfulfilled promise of reunion with ancestors left behind in a lost land. 

In Godsbreath, danger and beauty walk hand in hand. Along the southern coast, the murky, monster-stalked [[Nightwater Islands\|Nightwater Islands]] support tight-knit communities whose colourful houses perch on stilts. On the mainland, rising from the shore of [[Nightwater Cove\|Nightwater Cove]], stands [[Promise\|Promise]], a town of brightly painted buildings and bustling trade. Northward lies a band of crimson soil known as the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]]—the source of this land's agricultural prosperity—which weaves through woods and floodplains. Beyond the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]] spreads the treacherous land of the [[Rattle\|Rattle]], a territory that might hold the key to Godsbreath's future. 

Each year, [[Promise\|Promise]]'s streets fill with people celebrating the [[Awakening Festival\|Awakening Festival]], which centres around retelling Godsbreath's past and reckoning with its present. But every year the struggle to survive becomes more dire, as the land sickens and monstrous threats become more numerous. Why the land is turning against its people is a mystery to the people of Godsbreath and a matter the gods remain silent about. 

## Features
Those familiar with Godsbreath know the following details: 
**Hallmarks.** Godsbreath is a land known for its cooperative agricultural communities and the importance its people place on maintaining their oral history. 
**People.** The people of Godsbreath have skin tones ranging from the medium brown of copper to the near black of ebony, and most have tightly coiled dark-brown hair. Nonhumans and humans of other lands are rarely seen here; most who do live here dwell in Promise. 
**Languages.** The people of Godsbreath speak their own language, known as Godstongue, as well as Common. 

## Legends of Godsbreath
Most people in Godsbreath worship one or more of the [[Covenant\|Covenant]] gods, who worked together to bring the first folk to this new land. Over long generations since, these deities have stood united as the guardians of Godsbreath. But of late, they have begun to work independently to recruit and reward their own followers. Through recent prophecies known only to themselves, the members of the [[Covenant\|Covenant]] have learned the blood of a deity is needed to revitalise the soil of the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]] and stave off potential famine across Godsbreath. In response, the gods are becoming more active, shoring up their power to avoid becoming this necessary sacrifice.

## Noteworthy Sites
Godsbreath is bounded by the treacherous waters of [[Nightwater Cove\|Nightwater Cove]] and the dangerous expanse of the [[Rattle\|Rattle]].

### The Nightwater Isles
The [[Nightwater Isles\|Nightwater Isles]] rise from the waters of the murky cove from which they take their name. Though islanders mostly keep to themselves, their homes are visible from quite a distance, perched as they are on stilts to protect from floods. Each is painted in bold colours that not only honour the gods, but keep away the many monsters haunting the cove, including giant crocodiles, shambling mounds, and green hags.

Though each island has its own cultural and trade specialties, all the islands are connected to each other via flotillas of skims—flat-bottomed boats that ply the waters of the cove, operated by pilots known as skimmers.

### The Ribbon and The Rattle
The zone of fertile crimson soil known as the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]] cuts a wide swath through the gray-brown plains that stretch from the water's edge to the lands of the [[Rattle\|Rattle]]. Most inhabitants of the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]] live on small family farms joined together in pacts—resource-sharing alliances forged by common interest.

Inexplicably, the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]]'s soil grows less fertile each year, and no living soul in Godsbreath knows why. Residents of this land have been migrating into the fertile but dangerous lands of the [[Rattle\|Rattle]]. But [[Rattle\|Rattle]] farmers are threatened by oversized coyotes, bulettes, and other threats. Farmers whisper of strange magic that manifests without warning, causing unusual weather and reshaping the soil. Some believe these effects might be connected to ancient magics affecting the land or the will of the region's primary gods.
### Promise
[[Promise\|Promise]] is a town situated where the soil of the [[Ribbon\|Ribbon]] meets the [[Nightwater Cove\|Nightwater Cove]] coast. Its paved streets and colourful two-story buildings are home to [[Covenant\|Covenant]] worship houses, trader storehouses, schooling circles, and more. Promise is also home to the annual [[Awakening Festival\|Awakening Festival]], which brings together folk from across Godsbreath. 

Participants trade wares, relive their shared history through the call-and-response [[Awakening Song\|Awakening Song]], and settle regional disputes at the communal and annual summit known as the Meet, where canny traders and powerful pacts seek to gain influence.
## Life in Godsbreath
Those who dwell in or travel through Godsbreath understand the truths underlying life in this land.

### Community and Consensus
Each community in Godsbreath is self-governing, with intercommunity and regional disputes settled at the annual [[Meet\|Meet]]. Held in [[Promise\|Promise]] during the [[Awakening Festival\|Awakening Festival]], this public forum between community leaders seeks majority consensus on each issue raised. The [[Meet\|Meet]] continues until all items are resolved or half the participants leave.

Crime in Godsbreath is rare, and justice in this land focuses on making the wronged party whole. Decisions on how to make amends come through groups known as [[sevens\|sevens]]—assemblies of the seven people who are closest at hand when an accusation of criminal behaviour is made, but who have no direct stake in the outcome. For the most severe wrongs, offenders are banished to uninhabited islands, though they retain the right to travel to the [[Meet\|Meet]] each year to seek reconciliation with the larger community.

### The Gods' Tale
The influence of the deities who founded Godsbreath is captured in the [[Covenant\|Covenant]] tales—verses of the [[Awakening Song\|Awakening Song]] that tell stories of the gods' past exploits and share signs of their current influence. The bright colours found on homes throughout the region each honour a [[Covenant\|Covenant]] god, and many people craft and carry charms to invoke a favourite god's protection.

### Proclaimers and The Covenant
The [[Proclaimers\|Proclaimers]] of the [[Covenant\|Covenant]] are the acolytes of Godsbreath's deities, tasked with promoting worship of the [[Covenant\|Covenant]] and maintaining the [[Awakening Song\|Awakening Song]] as a living history of this land. They take turns traveling throughout Godsbreath, listening to deeds of local renown that could be added to the [[Awakening Song\|Awakening Song]], sharing stories from other regions, and challenging people to live up to the [[Covenant\|Covenant]] gods' example.

The [[Covenant\|Covenant]] is a pantheon of deities with a particular interest in Godsbreath. They have varied alignments and interests. 

### Shared Stories
Stories are the glue that binds Godsbreath together, tying its people to their ancestors who helped shape this land and passing down traditions and beliefs through all the generations since. Most people here begin conversations with "give a listen" or "tell me true" before exchanging stories—the more captivating, the better. Although this sometimes encourages exaggeration, Godsbreath's people believe you can hear truth in the telling of any tale, and all enjoy the art of a well-crafted boast.

Stories of all kinds are shared around the evening fire in the heart of each community, while folk dine on roast rabbit and hog, spoon bread, hominy, rice and gravy, corn pone, or crawfish stew. Especially captivating tales might be memorialized on a grass-woven story basket from the Nightwater Isles or added to a Ribbon family's fireside quilt, creating invaluable heirlooms protected at all costs. Truly extraordinary stories might even be captured in song by one of the Proclaimers of the Covenant. Having a story chosen is a great honor and can make alliances and invitations to adventure easier to come by.
