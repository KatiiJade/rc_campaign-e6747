While every world’s history is vast and fractured, with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn’s tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since.
