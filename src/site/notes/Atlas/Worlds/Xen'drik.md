Any follower of the Sovereign Host knows this story about Xen’drik. In the dawn of time, the Sovereigns bound the fiendish overlords and freed the world from chaos. The mighty giants had fought alongside the Sovereigns, and in gratitude Aureon granted them dominion over the continent of Xen’drik. Aureon taught giants the secrets of wizardry, and they grew powerful. The giants built towers that touched the sky and seemingly endless cities.

The mightiest among the giants was the titan Cul’sir. His power was so great that he pulled the thirteenth moon from the sky and crushed it in a fit of anger. The giants ruled many lesser races, and eventually the elves rose up against them. Cul’sir unleashed plagues upon the rebellious elves. He made assassins of elven shadows and turned them back against their owners. Still the rebels persisted. In his anger, Cul’sir prepared to pull down the rest of the moons to hurl them at his enemies, even though he’d destroy the world in doing it. But the giants had gone too far, and Aureon set the dragons of Argonnessen upon them. The dragons destroyed the vast cities and levelled the towers. Cul’sir was slain and his people scattered.

The Sovereigns and Six each laid a curse upon the land. Aureon decreed that the creatures of Xen’drik would have no knowledge of law, and Boldrei proclaimed that no city would stand. The Traveller distorted the land so that no path followed twice. The Devourer unleashed fire and storm. And so Xen’drik remains a land of mystery, a realm that cannot be mapped, a place that holds secrets that could shatter the world.

This story bears at least some truth. The elves were once slaves of the ancient giants, and the dragons did eradicate the civilisations of Xen’drik. Great magic has warped the land. The environments of Xen’drik are extreme and unpredictable, and travellers might find a glacial expanse in the midst of a vast desert. Tens of thousands of years have passed, yet no civilization has risen to the heights of the fallen giants; some believe that Aureon’s and Boldrei’s curses ensure that any city that grows too large collapses into madness. The Traveller’s Curse twists space, and explorers might follow the same path twice only to end up in entirely different locations.

Xen’drik is a continent that defies control. Expeditions have unearthed artifacts of immense power, as well as fields of Siberys dragonshards, but once you leave a site, you might never find it again.

Giants still roam Xen’drik, but these creatures have never regained the glory of their ancestors. Tribes of [[drow\|drow]]—said to be the shadow-assassins created by the Emperor Cul’sir—linger in the darkness. These represent just a few of the threats in this vast land.
