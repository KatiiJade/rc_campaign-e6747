## Campaign Structure
The [Journeys through the Radiant Citadel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/jttrc) is an anthology book of episodic adventures. I aim to include at least a few of them into the campaign, but I want to focus on a more cohesive narrative structure.  

There is an overarching plot that I would like to incorporate with the Player Characters and their own stories.

## Setting
The [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] is a large city located within the Deep Ethereal and is connected to different Civilisations across the [[Atlas/Multiverse\|Multiverse]].  This includes the Material Plane, along with the Outlands, demi-planes, and a parallel dimension. 

The Citadel was rediscovered 250 years ago by descendants of the original Civilisations after being lost for ages. Some Civilisations are still missing. These lost civilisations could be anywhere. 

The floating structure wraps around a colossal gemstone that shines colour shifting light on the city that never sleeps. The Citadel is a collaborative society that showcases aspects of various cultures and beautiful ecology; along with advances in arcane magic, knowledge, and technology.

## Difficulty Aim
Mostly medium encounters with resource management. Occasional hard or deadly encounters. I will advise when an encounter is balanced for hard or deadly.

## Character Creation
I will be running this campaign using 2024 5e rules. 
You are welcome to use 2014 material for character creation if it does not exist within current 2024 5e. I can help you adjust your character to suit 2024 rules if needed. During the campaign if any 2014 material used for your character creation  gets a 2024 update; it is your choice whether to update you character to the 2024 material or keep using your 2014 version.

### Starting Level and Expected Progression
We will be starting at level 1. I estimate the campaign to go up to Level 14-16.

### Stats and HP
We will be using Standard Array for character creation.
We will decide at [[Session 0\|Session 0]] if we will be using rolled or average HP. Please wait till Session 0 to work out your HP.

### DNDBeyond
You are welcome to join the Radiant Citadel campaign on DNDBeyond and create your character there. Content sharing will be enabled. If you want to use material that is in a sourcebook that I do not own, please let me know.

If you do not wish to use DNDBeyond for your character sheet, you will need to provide me a copy of your character sheet before [[Session 1\|Session 1]] and a copy after each level up before the next session.

### Approved Sourcebooks
You can use any official DND source including the Radiant Citadel. There are no player sections in the Radiant Citadel book. I will be providing player information through this wiki. If you would like any additional information, please reach out to me. I am open to you using third party material, but I will need to approve it first. 

### Character Origins

Your Character will be either a current denizen of the Radiant Citadel or from one of the connected Great Civilisations. 
If you choose to use a different source for your Civilisation than the Radiant Citadel or current Great Civilisations, your home may become one of the Great Civilisations that has recently been reconnected. If the source you want to use isn’t appropriate for the setting as a Civilisation, either your character or your species can be integrated into one of the current Great Civilisations or the Radiant Citadel.
Please choose your Character’s origins or roll on the table below.

### Character Faction and Organisation Affiliations
You may select a faction or organisation that your character is affiliated with. You can pick from the list below or work with me to create a different one. Your characters could have separate affiliations or the same affiliation (also called a group patron). If you wish your character may have no affiliations. 

The call to adventure section below has some affiliations listed in the options for your Characters relationship to the missing NPC. You may use this to help select your affiliations if you prefer.

#### Benefits
Your affiliated faction or organisation will provide your character with benefits including but not limited to a wage or gold for completed quests, access to facilities and resources, proficiencies and skills, and quests and assignments.

The [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]] require that basic income and housing is provided to all at the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]]. 
As such, your affiliated faction or organisation will provide basic income that covers food, water, and common needs, along with basic housing such as a dormitory or share house style.
If you choose not to have an affiliation that can provide this, you will either be a refugee sheltered at the [[Factions & Organisations/Palace of Exile\|Palace of Exile]] or a denizen provided with public housing and basic income by the [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]].

#### Potential Factions and Organisations
The list of factions and organisations below are all based in the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]]. These options have similar organisations or allies/rivals in the [[Atlas/Great Civilisations\|Great Civilisations]]. If you would like your character to be affiliated with a faction or organisation from one of the [[Atlas/Great Civilisations\|Great Civilisations]] instead, please let me know. We can also create a different faction or organisation if you have something else in mind.

Socorro and his staff care for refugees whilst they transition to life at the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] or help them relocate to a new land. They work with many individuals and organisations across the Citadel and Civilisations to achieve this.
