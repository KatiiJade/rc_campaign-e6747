Realmspace is a system made up of eight worlds orbiting a yellow sun, as shown on the accompanying map. The distances on the map and in the Realmspace table assume the use of a ship equipped with a _spelljamming helm_ (see "How Spelljamming Works" in chapter 2 of _Astral Adventurer's Guide_).

All the worlds of Realmspace have creatures and plants of one sort or another living on them. [[Atlas/Worlds/Toril\|Toril]] is the most Earthlike, while the outer worlds (Glyth, [[Atlas/Worlds/Garden\|Garden]], and H'catha) are on the other end of the spectrum.

|Planet|World Type|Distance to Outer Edge of System|
|---|---|---|
|Anadia|Spherical earth body|3,150 million miles (31½ days travel)|
|Coliar|Spherical air body|3,100 million miles (31 day travel)|
|Toril|Spherical earth body orbited by one moon (Selûne) and an asteroid cluster (Tears of Selûne)|3,000 million miles (30 days travel)|
|Karpri|Spherical water body|2,900 million miles (29 days travel)|
|Chandos|Spherical water body|2,800 million miles (28 days travel)|
|Glyth|Spherical, ringed earth body orbited by three moons|2,200 million miles (22 days travel)|
|Garden|Cluster of seven earth bodies held together by a colossal plant, orbited by eleven moons|2,000 million miles (20 days travel)|
|H'catha|Disk-shaped water body orbited by two moons|1,600 million miles (16 days travel)|
