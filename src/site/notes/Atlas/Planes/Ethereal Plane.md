The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fogbound dimension. Its “shores,” called the [[Atlas/Planes/Border Ethereal\|Border Ethereal]], overlap the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]], the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]], the [[Atlas/Planes/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]], and the Inner Planes, and every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the [[Atlas/Planes/Border Ethereal\|Border Ethereal]] is usually limited to 60 feet. The plane’s depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog called the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]], where visibility is usually limited to 30 feet.

Characters can use the ***Etherealness*** spell to enter the [[Atlas/Planes/Border Ethereal\|Border Ethereal]]. The ***Plane Shift*** spell allows transport to the [[Atlas/Planes/Border Ethereal\|Border Ethereal]] or the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]], but unless the intended destination is a specific location or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be anywhere on the plane.

## Locations
The [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] is located within the [[Atlas/Planes/Deep Ethereal\|Deep Ethereal]] of the Ethereal Plane.
