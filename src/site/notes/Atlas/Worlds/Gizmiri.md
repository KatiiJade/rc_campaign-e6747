Gizmiri is a wasteland of red desert sand, clay, and bones, the remnants of entire armies of Khandiria, and most of it could easily be considered the western part of the Red Wastes. Little grows here and most inhabitants are kobolds and dragonkin who profit from the region’s mines. The ruins of several Khandirian cities litter the plain, each thoroughly sacked and plundered when the Dragon Empire took the city. In other places, small hills stand out from the flat landscape; these are the burial mounds of dragons slain in battle by Khandirian sorcery.
