The Tayyib Empire recently emerged from a brutal civil war, but its peace is fragile. Monsters roam the hinterland, and people vie for power to stave off desperation during the recovery. 

The war began in response to the death of [[Emperor Tasneem\|Emperor Tasneem]], whose older heirs turned to sinister magic in their attempts to rule. These heirs burned the former capital and unleashed legions of unliving horrors. Chaos ruled the land until the emperor's youngest daughter, [[Firuzeh\|Firuzeh]], defeated her siblings and ascended the throne. 

She inherited a nation stretched to the limit. But across war-torn territories, people rebuild marble domes and sparkling minarets to raise a new empire that serves its citizens as past rulers failed to do. It is a precarious time, but also one of great opportunity. 

## Pronunciation
Tayyib- TAY-yib

## Features
Those familiar with the Tayyib Empire know the following facts: 
**Hallmarks.**  Tayyib Empire is recovering for a brutal civil war. The community is rebuilding under their new Empress Firuzeh. However, the undead that were created during the war, still roam.
**People of Tayyib Empire.** Nearly half the population are brown-skinned humans, with significant elf, hobgoblin, lizardfolk, and yuan-ti populations making up most of the remainder. 
**Languages.** The language of Tayyib Empire is Tayya, but people also know Common. 

## Noteworthy Sites
The Tayyib Empire spans a region called [[Suristhanam\|Suristhanam]]. Its geography includes a great central flood plain, fertile hills, and tropical swamps.

### Qaragarh
A metropolis filled with breathtaking plazas and public reflecting pools, the empire's new capital teems with people who see the city as the promise of the empress made manifest. Adventurers come to [[Qaragarh\|Qaragarh]] seeking employment from the empress, who needs support to stabilize her empire. Travelers arrive and depart through the [[Hall of Doors\|Hall of Doors]], which houses teleportation circles linked to locations across the empire.

### Bijabad
[[Bijabad\|Bijabad]] and the surrounding region were the breadbasket of the empire until war took its toll. Now bulettes and griffons terrorize the countryside, and work crews periodically unearth Undead left behind by the conflict. The city's struggling reconstruction efforts are chronically understaffed, so a grassroots network of veterans and influential townsfolk called the [[Old Sickles\|Old Sickles]] has taken efforts into its own hands.
### Churpoor
A natural harbor shelters the port of [[Churapoor\|Churapoor]] from seasonal monsoons. Despite the devastation of war, the city boasts a healthy economy, but it always needs adventurers to guard its shipments of alchemical concoctions, spices, and rich textiles.
## Life in Tayyib Empire
The Tayyib Empire is a cosmopolitan mix of the native peoples of [[Suristhanam\|Suristhanam]], immigrants, and various invading groups. Nearly half the population are brown-skinned humans, with significant elf, hobgoblin, lizardfolk, and yuan-ti populations making up most of the remainder.

### Faith and Religion
The dominant faith is [[Iwahhid\|Iwahhid]], a philosophy that rejects idols and promotes worshiping the source of divinity rather than its fallible manifestations. Its adherents are called [[Muwahhid\|Muwahhid]]. Some erudite worshipers join the [[Imperial Ulema\|Imperial Ulema]], an order of [[Muwahhid\|Muwahhid]] scholars sponsored by the throne. The Ulema provides spellcasting services to the populace and maintains the empire's infrastructure of magical street lights and teleportation circles.
### Fashion and Food
Clothing in the empire tends to be long and billowing. Men's fashion includes jamas and sherwanis, or loose kurtas secured with a shawl. Women's fashion includes saris and salwars. Clothing is colourful and patterned, with some wealthy citizens sporting garments bearing magic that perfumes the wearer on command or changes color.

Tayyib dishes are creamy and mildly spiced, cooked with yogurt, and served with rice or flatbreads. Dried lentils are soaked and made into various dal dishes, while slow-cooked rice, spices, and vegetables are transformed into fragrant biryani. Faithful Muwahhid avoid alcohol and predator meat, and many are vegetarians.
### Monarchy and Order
Authority in the Tayyib Empire stems from [[Empress Firuzeh\|Empress Firuzeh]]. Nobles who hold prewar titles are respected, while state-appointed judges enforce the law across the empire. This system is prone to corruption, but the empress's agents vigilantly ferret out dishonest officials, delegating that task to trustworthy adventurers when necessary.
### The Tayyib Empire Today
Though the scars of war are visible throughout [[Suristhanam\|Suristhanam]], the Tayyib Empire is cosmopolitan, industrial, and urbane. Where rebuilding is in full swing, the streets are illuminated with magic and enchanted trinkets can be purchased on the open market. Where it isn’t, the work for that infrastructure has begun, but the wealth hasn’t yet followed. In rural areas, the backcountry, and the most devastated parts of the country, there is still great deprivation as people try to piece their lives back together or wait for that promised golden age to arrive.
### The Walking Dead
In the Tayyib Empire, the undead are mobile, murderous reminders of the war’s toll. The old capitol at [[Sherpatta\|Sherpatta]] was destroyed in a necromantic ritual, unleashing thousands of undead upon the land. Unquiet corpses and restless shades are a constant presence, living evidence of atrocities buried by the simple length and brutality of the war. While destroying the undead is a practical move everywhere, in the Tayyib Empire it has a second role: bringing peace and closure to the bereaved. Organisations, like the [[Sherpatta Gravetenders\|Sherpatta Gravetenders]], hunt down the undead, then use magic and investigative work to learn who they were and how they died. The information
is delivered to families and used to bring justice to the worst villains who survived the war.

Adventurers are often brought in to assist with this task. The Gravetenders are a volunteer movement, while the army moves slowly and on its own schedule. Often enough, local heroes are the only ones capable of destroying a concentration of the undead and learning their tales.
