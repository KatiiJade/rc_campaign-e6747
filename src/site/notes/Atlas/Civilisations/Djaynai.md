Modern Djaynai is a coastal realm descended from a grand civilisation. Though the nation has never been defeated by external forces, its fortunes were greatly diminished hundreds of years ago after raiders perpetrated atrocities upon the land and its people in a series of attacks known as the [[Passage of Vultures\|Passage of Vultures]]. Djaynai's defenders drove the raiders off, albeit at a high cost. Even in its diminished state, the nation serves as an exemplar of self-sovereignty and dignity, defended by scouts known as the [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]], who watch for bandit groups and marauders aiming to raid Djaynai and its neighbours. 

During the [[Passage of Vultures\|Passage of Vultures]], countless captured Djaynaians leaped from the ships of the marauders, like raindrops falling into the sea. "Freedom now!" they shouted as they sought the ocean's embrace. In the midnight depths, those ancient Djaynaians called upon their magic and that of the [[Nightsea\|Nightsea]], and they were transformed into beings dubbed [[Nightsea Chil-liren\|Nightsea Chil-liren]], gifted with the ability to live in the deep. Over centuries, they became the civilisation known as [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]]. 

## Pronunciation
Chil-liren - CHILL-l'ren
Djaynai - JAY-nigh
Janya - JAN-yuh

**Hallmarks.** These lands are known for their ancestral legacies, political schisms, and transformed cultures. 
**Djaynai's People.** Djaynai's folk are mostly human and have tightly curled hair, which is worn in a variety of natural and ornate styles. Their lustrous skin tones range from warm ebony and mahogany to the coppery glow of the setting sun. Gnomes, dragonborn, elves and orcs are common and accepted in Djaynai. 
**Djaynai's Languages.** The people of Djaynai speak Djaynaian, Common, and occasionally Aquan. 

## Legends of Djaynai and Janya
Djaynai has been a beacon of independence and knowledge for millennia. Indeed, Djaynai has ultimately prevailed over all invaders, with a key role played by the mystical practices known as the [[Blackmist Way\|Blackmist Way]] and [[Blackthrone Arts\|Blackthrone Arts]]. Unfortunately, Djaynai's friendly neighbouring realms are more often threatened. For instance, inscrutable [[lizardfolk\|lizardfolk]] in the wetlands periodically congregate and cause havoc in the nearby ocean. The [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]]—who take their name from the shallow coastal waters Djaynaians call the [[Lightsea\|Lightsea]]—was formed to monitor such threats before they impact Djaynai. Travellers occasionally come to Djaynai to learn the [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]]' ways, as their heroics, dance-like martial arts, and knowledge of transmutation magic are renowned throughout Djaynai and beyond.

Beneath the [[Nightsea\|Nightsea]], the realm of [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]] has its own tales. Many tell of how early Janyans were focused not only on rebuilding their lives but on preserving what they treasured from the land above. To keep such lore safe, ancestral Janyans built structures in hidden reaches, like the [[Trench of Love Lost\|Trench of Love Lost]], to archive sacred wisdom before it was lost. Eventually, though, such archives faded from memory. Profound Djaynaian secrets remain hidden in the deep, awaiting rekindling.

Modern [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]] is a majestic, deep-sea city protected by magical wards that resemble an opalescent aurora with the sheen of a blue-black pearl. Its buildings are castle-like structures resembling those of Djaynai above, but made from magically hardened, obsidian-hued silt and studded by crystalline support beams jutting from the smooth walls.

## Noteworthy Sites
Djaynai is a peaceful land dominated by mangrove forests along the southern coast and jagged cliffs to the north. Its calm coastal waters are known as the [[Lightsea\|Lightsea]], but beyond a continental shelf the waters grow suddenly deeper. This is the [[Nightsea\|Nightsea]], the shadowy depths that hold the vibrant city of [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]].

### Castle Djaynai
[[Castle Djaynai\|Castle Djaynai]] is made from onyx-colored mud brick studded with wooden pilasters and features a roof of sharp pinnacles. It is home to the rotating representative government called the [[People's Stewards\|People's Stewards]], and its chambers hold ornate rugs and tapestries, the fragrance of essential oils, and performances of hypnotic music, which combine to create a warm welcome for invited guests. To deter intruders, the castle is lined with magical traps that polymorph victims into the saltwater salamanders common among Djaynai's mangroves.

### Ancestors' Danse House
Home to the spiritual faction known as the [[Night Revelers\|Night Revelers]], the [[Ancestors' Danse House\|Ancestors' Danse House]] in Djaynai is a mausoleum with smooth, chalky-white, mud-brick walls.  Its library contains numerous scrolls of magical lore, and thousands of ancestors' bones in ossuaries throughout the site are enchanted to magically rise as skeletons and defend against would-be-thieves.

## Life in Djaynai and Janya
The following truths are known to people who dwell in Djaynai or [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]], and to travellers who spend time in those realms. Those above and below the sea share similar cultures and values, though [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]]'s aquatic environment drives some differences.

### Education and Religion
Both realms' culture is tightly tied to Djaynai's historical roots as an advanced, influential civilisation. Education and creativity are the foundations of the culture, and its people embrace philosophy, magic, mathematics, and the study of underwater societies. In keeping with these traditions, spirituality isn't focused on gods, but on revering and emulating forces such as liberation, fluidity, and change. As such, most people are open to the spiritual views of others, as long as those views don't embrace evil.

### Food and Clothing
Meals are considered sacred in Djaynai, and wasting food is a major breach of etiquette. Key ingredients of Djaynai's cuisine include banana, groundnut, milk from several types of animals, red and black beans, and chili peppers. In [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]], edible undersea plants form the bulk of people's diet, supplemented by ingredients imported from Djaynai. As a rule, both peoples eschew eating meat.

Djaynaian clothing combines rough-spun and delicate materials, and it is common to see linen with lace or damask with crocheted fabrics in the same outfit. Most Djaynaians wear a form of shawl or cloak at all times, and their fashion favors muted colors. Headwear is typically worn in public, most commonly cowls with pointed caps, wide-brimmed hats, or tagelmusts and tasuwarts that can function as headgear and veil. Clothing in [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]] parallels Djaynaian style but features materials like eel skin and elegantly woven sea grasses.

### Government in Djaynai
The government of Djaynai is called the [[People's Stewards\|People's Stewards]], whose leadership ranks change whenever a significant number of citizens publicly call for new elections. All citizens of Djaynai are simultaneously seen as nobles, workers, and potential Stewards. The anarchic spiritual group called the [[Night Revelers\|Night Revelers]] poses a challenge to the Stewards' authority, arguing that Djaynai must abandon all government to truly be free.

The security forces that protect Djaynai—including the scouts known as [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]]—are highly effective in their roles, but Djaynaian law emphasizes redemption over punishment. In the direst criminal cases, controversial rituals are performed to prevent the offender from acting on their wicked impulses. The offender is then banished for life.

### Music
Traditional music in both realms functions to spiritually transfigure listeners. It emphasizes low tones and syncopated rhythms, utilizing stringed instruments such as the lute-like guembri, akoting, and xalam; the musical bow known as the berimbau; and the sonorous atabaque drum.

## Characters from Djaynai
If players create characters from Djaynai or with ties to Janya, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**How do you feel about the Will of the Insurgent Tides?** Do you support the quest to recover the lore of the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts, or are they relics of an unrecoverable past?
**Do you or anyone in your family have a connection to the Night Revelers?** Do you embrace that faction's call to anarchy, or do you seek to undermine that call before it spreads further?
**Whether you come from Djaynai or Janya, how much do you know of the other realm?** Do you consider yourself a person of two worlds? Or do you yearn for a greater understanding of your kin on the other side of the water's surface?

### Names
Djaynaians and Janyans use only single names publicly, reserving family names for close loved ones. In both realms, those family names combine Djaynaian words focused on nature, such as Pineshadow or Misthare. The following are common public names:

**Feminine.** Chainay, Fantou, Imané, Kadidia, Khonjit, Lashall
**Masculine.** Adesola, Alphiadou, Bacar, D'arael, Darweshi, Mayn
**Gender-Neutral.** Akkia, Evlyn, Jayvyn, Kellar, Kioné, Lakarai
