The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a gloomy dimension whose sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.

The Shadowfell overlaps the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] in much the same way as the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Aside from the bleak landscape, it appears similar to the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]]. Travellers from the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] who enter the Shadowfell often observe landmarks similar to the world they left, but distorted and often sinister. A mountain on the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] might be replaced in the Shadowfell by a skull-shaped rock outcropping, a heap of rubble, or the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. The forests of the Shadowfell hold sinister-looking trees, their branches reaching out to snare travellers’ cloaks, and their roots coiling to trip those who pass by.

Shadow dragons and Undead haunt this bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the gloom, including cloakers and darkmantles.

## Locations
[[Atlas/Planes/Domain of Dread\|Domain of Dread]] are demi-planes that exist in the far-flung corners of Shadowfell.
