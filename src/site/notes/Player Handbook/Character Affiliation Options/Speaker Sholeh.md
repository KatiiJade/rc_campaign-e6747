Sholeh is a legendary figure in the history of the Citadel. Having led the successful effort to rediscover the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]], she was the first [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speaker for the Ancestors]] and is the only originator of that position to still hold the office. This is, at least in part, because she is a famed ancient brass dragon of [[Akharin Sangar.\|Akharin Sangar.]] Unlike many of her kind, she is neutral good and a pragmatic, shrewd leader. For two hundred and fifty years, she has been a consummate councillor and has deftly managed the complex politics of the city. She hopes to find the missing founding civilisations and believes the fate of the Citadel depends on it.

### Main Objective
Relocating and reconnecting lost civilisations to the Citadel. Focusing on building diplomatic relations with the found lost civilisations. 
### Assignments
Characters to take on a variety of missions including political and diplomatic assignments, research and finding lost knowledge, and locating and reconnecting lost civilisations to the Citadel. 

#### Limitations
The Speakers' first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel's policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilizations or otherwise.

However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources.

### Benefits
- Starting salary of 10gp.
- Accommodation and travel expenses covered for off-Citadel assignments.
- Diplomatic immunity (as long as you stay in her good graces).
- Access to high echelons of society. 
- Access to equipment and research.
- Proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice.
