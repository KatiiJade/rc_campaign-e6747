Amid a vivid patchwork of rural farms and dense mountain jungles stands the bustling, unforgettable [[Dyn Singh Night Market\|Dyn Singh Night Market]]. The heart of the valley of Siabsungkoh, this regional market attracts visitors from distant lands with delicious foods, rare treasures, and all manner of unpredictable fortunes. Tourists nicknamed this ever-changing district the "Dancing Night Market" due to its festive atmosphere and the colourful displays of magical lights that illuminate vendors' wares. 

Beyond Siabsungkoh's regional market district, lush jungles are home to rare plants and animals, including the famous bioluminescent lau-pop flower. These flowers bathe the mountains nightly in soft, blue-purple light. Well-kept roads crisscross the region, connecting the populous [[Dyn Singh Night Market\|Dyn Singh Night Market]] with the scattered communities of the [[Outer Edges\|Outer Edges]], which border the mountains. 

Tradition, trade, and enterprise influence culture in Siabsungkoh. Families spend generations cultivating reputations as experts in varied trades or fields. The inner workings of the markets where families meet and trade are complicated, rife with competition and alliances. Rival families occasionally clash with one another; their conflicts typically take the form of insults and rumour-mongering, but sometimes escalate to violent scuffles. Some traditionalists fear losing their cultural identity and connection to the natural world, and they wish to disrupt the growing impact of mercantilism on local life.

## Legends of Siabsungkoh
The oldest legend of Siabsungkoh tells of a young sorcerer, [[Phi Maymoon\|Phi Maymoon]], who made a pact with nature spirits to protect Siabsungkoh from invaders that were closing in from the west and south. In an act of desperation, Phi climbed [[Avyrn Mountain\|Avyrn Mountain]] and pleaded with the spirits to protect the land's people. The spirits answered Phi's call. With their combined power, they shifted the earth around Siabsungkoh to form jagged mountains that blocked the invasion. This exchange of power was not without a cost—Phi traded their life to form the barrier that protects Siabsungkoh. Phi's magical power lives on in the mountains and is supposedly the force that gives lau-pop flowers their remarkable glow. To this day, many honor the spirits of Siabsungkoh by tending gardens of lau-pop flowers or climbing [[Avyrn Mountain\|Avyrn Mountain]] to leave offerings to Phi.

## Noteworthy Sites
Siabsungkoh features lush, tropical jungles surrounded by mountains. The valley is small but buzzes with energy, as both locals and tourists frequent the markets that serve as a hub of community life.

### Dyn Singh Night Market
Traders from Siabsungkoh's scattered communities flock nightly to the [[Dyn Singh Night Market\|Dyn Singh Night Market]], an ever-changing, town-sized market. Food vendors take center stage, selling noodles, seafood, pot stickers, and other delicacies from colourful stalls and carts. Visitors might sample fine desserts, seek the expert works of artisan families, or be entertained by groups like the folklore-sharing [[Dancers of Smoke\|Dancers of Smoke]].

Becoming a vendor at the [[Dyn Singh Night Market\|Dyn Singh Night Market]] involves gaining the favour of the five oldest families of Siabsungkoh, then paying a large fee to "prove success." While this approval process was initially created to prevent corruption, many would-be vendors spend years saving for the fee even after earning the families' favour. Many older families have grown greedy and try to stifle competition from new vendors.

### Outer Edges
The region of Siabsungkoh that borders the wilderness, the [[Outer Edges\|Outer Edges]] are overgrown with lush greenery and lau-pop flowers. Many of the scattered communities here and across the valley reject the bureaucracy and crowds of the market district, braving the dangers of the nearby wilderness to stay self-sufficient. Merchants not accepted in the [[Dyn Singh Night Market\|Dyn Singh Night Market]] do business here, some trading in doubtful goods and sinister magic. For example, the [[Nyvrn Candy Cart\|Nyvrn Candy Cart]] sells an array of magical and cursed candies, while [[Hiccup's Generally Nice Goods\|Hiccup's Generally Nice Goods]] barters "discounted" [[Atlas/Civilisations/Akharin Sangar\|Sangarian]] rugs and "semi-genuine" painted porcelain from the [[Atlas/Civilisations/Yongjing\|Yongjing]].

Some Outer Edges residents chase knowledge of the natural world, such as the scholarly [[Preed\|Preed]] family, whose members believe the land has grown angry and will soon swallow Siabsungkoh whole.

### Avyrn Mountain
Centuries ago, a young sorcerer named [[Phi Maymoon\|Phi Maymoon]] scaled [[Avyrn Mountain\|Avyrn Mountain]] and pleaded with the nature spirits there to protect Siabsungkoh from invaders. Locals who believe this legend climb the mountain and leave offerings of food and drink on the cliffside to show respect and provide nourishment to the sorcerer. They believe Phi's pact with the spirits protects them still.

Beyond this memorial is the domain of the mountain's spirits. The mountain guardian, [[Saan\|Saan]], resides within a cave at the mountain's top. It is said the bonds of friendship are tested within [[Saan\|Saan]]'s cave. Explorers who prove true to their friends and family are blessed; those who don't find their relationships shattered.

## Life in Siabsungkoh
The following truths are known to those who live in Siabsungkoh or travel through these lands.

### Dyn Singh Merchant Collective
The finest merchant families in Siabsungkoh make up the [[Dyn Singh Merchant Collective\|Dyn Singh Merchant Collective]]. These families worked for generations to grow their businesses' reputations and the quality of their wares. The collective sets laws for trade throughout the land, issues licensing for harvesting natural resources, and establishes the rules of business in the night market. However, their success pushes some greedy members of the collective to keep the group exclusive so they can maintain their own power.

### The [[Five Families\|Five Families]]
Siabsungkoh is ruled by the heads of the land's five oldest families, three of which are members of the [[Dyn Singh Merchant Collective\|Dyn Singh Merchant Collective]]. In recent years, the government has expanded the market further to encourage greater trade opportunities. This pushed the market into the center of local life, rankling traditionalists and causing many to believe the nation is sacrificing its ties to the natural world.

### Family First
Siabsungkoh is a collectivist society centered on family and deep group loyalties. Families are often blended and can grow through marriage, through adoption, or by simply choosing to accept someone as a family member. Found families are equal to traditional families and often adopt a family name or symbol. The first families that settled Siabsungkoh are said to have been of different blood but the same spirit. Those who operate alone through choice or act in self-serving ways are often called tuah, which means "of lonely heart."

### Visitors Welcome
Siabsungkoh's people have a reputation for being friendly and welcoming; however, trust is reserved for those who earn it. Locals are overly polite and use double-speak when addressing strangers. Newcomers who learn the customs and work within the cultural framework, however, can earn places and renown within the communities.

### Spirits of the Land
Most Siabsungkoh residents deeply appreciate nature and the spirits that inhabit it. Individuals often leave cut mangoes in streams as offerings for the nature spirits, or spend time at the [[Lynx River\|Lynx River]] or [[Slumber Pond\|Slumber Pond]] to meditate on reflections in the water. Some forgo the duties of family, seeking to attune with nature and work the will of the spirits at the [[Temple of Ember\|Temple of Ember]].

Many animals are believed to be messengers of the spirits. Of particular mystical prominence are tut-krogh caterpillars—which create stunning iridescent silk before they transform into tea-moths—and pangolins, which are said to comfort souls in times of hardship.
