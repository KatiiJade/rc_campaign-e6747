To reach the Deep Ethereal, one typically needs a ***Plane Shift*** spell, a ***Gate*** spell, or a magical portal. Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling mist. Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of vaporous colour, and passing through a curtain leads a traveller to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to a specific Inner Plane, the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]], the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]], or the [[Atlas/Planes/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]]. The colour of the curtain indicates the plane whose [[Atlas/Planes/Border Ethereal\|Border Ethereal]] the curtain conceals; see the Ethereal Curtains table. The curtains are also distinguishable by texture and temperature, each one reflecting something of the nature of the plane beyond.

## Locations
The [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] is located within the Deep Ethereal of the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]].
