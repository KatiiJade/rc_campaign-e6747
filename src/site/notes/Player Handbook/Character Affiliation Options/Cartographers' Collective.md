In a beautiful house near the [[Passage of Respite\|Passage of Respite]], a loose grouping of interested geographers holds lectures and keeps a library of maps relating to all the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] civilisations for reference. Collective members wear small brass pins showing thirteen small jewels orbiting a diamond. [[Jayvyn\|Jayvyn]] greets any guests and introduces them to the collection. [[Jayvyn\|Jayvyn]] is a scholar unmoored from his home and stranded in the Ethereal. He founded the Collective in order to help him find his lost home.
