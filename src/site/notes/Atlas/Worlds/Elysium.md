Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and a refuge for planar travelers seeking a safe haven. The plane’s bucolic landscapes glimmer with life and beauty.

The [[Atlas/Worlds/River Oceanus\|River Oceanus]] originates in the lowest layer of Elysium, Thalasia, and flows through the plane’s layers before cascading onward to the Beastlands. Though illustrations of the plane’s layers seem to show the river flowing “up” from each layer to the one “above” it, the experience of passing from one layer to another on the river is no more dramatic than weathering rapids on any ordinary river. Along its course, the great river splits into myriad smaller flows, recombines, and splits again.

## Locations
[[Atlas/Civilisations/Dayawlongon\|Dayawlongon]] is located in the [[Atlas/Worlds/River Oceanus\|River Oceanus]] in Elysium.
