> | 500 years ago | City [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]] was destroyed |

Shaped and defined by its rivers, Shankhabhumi is a dynamic floodplain surrounded by mountains and crisscrossed by waterways. Most of the land is covered in swamp forests infested with unknown perils, except for three city-states that stand proudly on broad islands of miraculously dry land. The islands on which the cities of [[Ashwadhatu\|Ashwadhatu]], [[Sagorpur\|Sagorpur]], and [[Tippurika\|Tippurika]] stand were each granted to the people by a different riverine, and at the heart of each city is a temple dedicated to that city's patron riverine. A fourth city, [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]], was destroyed in a cataclysm five hundred years ago. 

Each city spreads out in concentric circles from its riverine temple. The innermost circle holds the city's senate house, main market, and academy, as well as the houses of wealthy citizens. Past these lie modest residential neighbourhoods and trade wards. At its edges, each city slopes down to submerged rice fields before dissipating into the swamps. The skies of Shankhabhumi are eternally heavy with rainclouds, and even well-maintained buildings wear a fine coat of moss. 

To experience Shankhabhumi at its finest, one must visit during the [[Shankha Trials\|Shankha Trials]], held every twelve years in one of the three cities. A twelve-day spectacle of skill and might, the trials feature contestants representing each city who entertain thousands of spectators. But the trials are more than a competition; they represent the origin story of the land and a pact endlessly renewed between the people and the [[riverines\|riverines]] to whom the land belongs.

## Legends of Shankhabhumi
The ancestors of the people of Shankhabhumi migrated here from other lands about a thousand years ago. They arrived to find swamp forests infested with monsters and other dangers—a land shaped by hundreds of [[riverines\|riverines]] who were indifferent to the newcomers and their fates. Then the elven leader [[Kubjhatika\|Kubjhatika]] killed a giant mollusk that attacked her people. After the battle, she carved the tale of her victory and her people's journey on a beautiful, red-ridged shell. This shell became the [[Riverine's Shankha\|Riverine's Shankha]]. [[Kubjhatika\|Kubjhatika]] offered it as tribute to the [[riverines\|riverines]], appealing to them for refuge amid the unforgiving land.

The four greatest [[riverines\|riverines]]—[[Adirohit\|Adirohit]], [[Iravati\|Iravati]], [[Mehul\|Mehul]], and [[Joltara\|Joltara]]—each wished to claim the [[Riverine's Shankha\|Riverine's Shankha]] as their own. [[Kubjhatika\|Kubjhatika]] proposed the [[Shankha Trials\|Shankha Trials]] to ensure it would circulate fairly. But since people who could barely survive in this unstable land couldn't put on such a spectacular event, [[Kubjhatika\|Kubjhatika]] persuaded the [[riverines\|riverines]] to each create a site for a great city. Thus, the [[riverines\|riverines]] created the stable islands on which [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]], [[Sagorpur\|Sagorpur]], [[Ashwadhatu\|Ashwadhatu]], and [[Tippurika\|Tippurika]] would be built, and the histories of those great cities began.

## Noteworthy Sites
Hundreds of rivers flow through Shankhabhumi, creating natural paths to its three great cities.

### Ashwadhatu
The [[Mehul River\|Mehul River]] flows from the [[Nirjhar Highlands\|Nirjhar Highlands]], through [[Ashwadhatu\|Ashwadhatu]], and on to [[Dishahara Bay\|Dishahara Bay]]. The city of Shankhabhumi with the largest area of solid land, [[Ashwadhatu\|Ashwadhatu]] has long been the home of proud, traditionalist farmers, miners, and boatbuilders. More recently, metalworkers and inventors are fuelling a growing industry, though some citizens dismiss them as eccentrics creating unnecessary, newfangled contrivances.

### Sagorpur
[[Sagorpur\|Sagorpur]] is the mightiest city of Shankhabhumi, having inherited that mantle when [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]] was ruined five centuries ago. The city lies where the [[Iravati River\|Iravati River]] flows into [[Dishahara Bay\|Dishahara Bay]], and its mainstay is sea trade. A wide array of goods can be purchased in the city's sprawling markets, and seafaring foreigners and inland travellers from [[Tippurika\|Tippurika]] and [[Ashwadhatu\|Ashwadhatu]] mingle with locals in [[Sagorpur\|Sagorpur]]'s numerous inns, playhouses, gambling dens, and restaurants.

### Tippurika
The city of [[Tippurika\|Tippurika]] stands where the [[Joltara River\|Joltara River]] flows from the [[Adhameru Mountains\|Adhameru Mountains]] into a deep canyon, frothing with whitewater rapids. Tippuri citizens—a majority of them dwarves and halflings—are adept at climbing steep paths, traversing unstable rope bridges, fishing in mountain rapids, and exploring the inaccessible caves of the mountains. The city is known for its hill crops—particularly tea and timber. Locals take pride in their staunch courage and infuriating stubbornness in equal measure.

## Life in Shankhabhumi
Outsiders often refer to the people of Shankhabhumi collectively as "riverlanders," but the folk of the three city-states call themselves Sagorpuri, Ashwadhatuj, or Tippuri, and claim to have little in common with one another. However, that's an exaggeration; the people of Shankhabhumi share unifying traits and experiences.

### Clothing and Accoutrements
The folk of Shankhabhumi favor clothing composed of lengths of cotton or silk cloth called bastras, which are wrapped around the body in various styles. These include the loose, voluminous drapes of a sedentary noble, the tight, rope-like wrap of a Shankha Trials contestant, and the practical, gathered garments of a laborer or river navigator.

Wavy or curly hair is common in the region; people rub it to a shine with coconut oil and wear it long or in thick plaits. Ornaments include conch-shell bangles and hairpieces, as well as designs of white clay painted directly onto the skin. Gold and gemstone jewelry, a specialty of the ruined city of Manivarsha, is popular among wealthy citizens and often crafted by the descendants of artisans from the Manivarshi diaspora.

### Manivarshi Diaspora
The city-state of [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]] was destroyed five hundred years ago under circumstances that have never fully been explained. On the last day of that year's [[Shankha Trials\|Shankha Trials]], the city simply vanished, along with everyone there. A few survivors who were just outside the city at the time told of a towering wave along the [[Adirohit River\|Adirohit River]] that marked its demise; subsequent attempts to reach its former location found nothing but endless swamps. Citizens who were away from home were left stranded. Those survivors and their descendants assimilated into the other cities, bringing [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]]'s traditions of gem-cutting and jewel-setting to their new homes. This jewellery is now common throughout the land, and many pieces are fantastically valuable.

### Power and Politics
Aside from their cultural rivalries, [[Sagorpur\|Sagorpur]], [[Tippurika\|Tippurika]] and [[Ashwadhatu\|Ashwadhatu]] rarely engage in major conflicts—living in a land that constantly changes with the caprices of the riverines is precarious enough. The shadow of the lost city of [[Manivarsha\|Manivarsha]] hangs over the remaining cities as a reminder that life in Shankhabhumi can easily be swept away.

Power in each city is shared between three factions—fifteen senators who officially govern the affairs of the city-state; a network of river-navigator [[majhis\|majhis]] known as the [[Bhatiyali\|Bhatiyali]]; and former [[Shankha Trials\|Shankha Trials]] contestants who become famous public entertainers and heroes, if they don't become senators themselves.

### River Bounty
Every meal in Shankhabhumi includes fish, though each city proclaims its own style of preparing it to be the best. In fact, cooking is a competitive discipline at the [[Shankha Trials\|Shankha Trials]]. Sagorpuri fish curries are fragrant with spices imported from foreign lands, while Ashwadhatuj cook their fish with locally farmed vegetables, and Tippuris ferment their mountain fish in tea.

### Sign of the Shanka
The shell of the conch mollusk, known locally as a shankha, is the eponymous icon of Shankhabhumi. The sizable Riverine's Shankha is the legendary shell trophy that circulates among the cities via the Shankha Trials, kept at the riverine temple in the current champion's city until that city hosts the next trials. Smaller shankhas are rare and precious, and they are often worn like pendants by those who can afford them. Shankha motifs decorate all riverine temples and adorn weaving, white-clay body art, jewelry, children's toys, pastries, and more.

## Characters from Shankhabhumi
If players create characters from Shankhabhumi, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Which city do you come from?** Were you raised in cosmopolitan Sagorpur, traditionalist Ashwadhatu, or hardy Tippurika?
**Are you looking forward to the next Shankha Trials?** Are the trials the best part of living in Shankhabhumi for you, or just a spectacular nuisance every twelve years? Have you participated in past trials?
**Have you ever encountered a riverine?** Did the unpredictable spirit harm you or bless you in some way? Have you seen the riverine since then? Do you now have a deeper connection to it?

### Names
The given names of people in Shankhabhumi tend to be many syllables long and indicate the bearer's gender. Most folk use a last name based on their city of birth—Sagorpuri, Ashwadhatuj or Tippuri. The only exceptions are the descendants of Manivarsha (many of whom still use "Manivarshi") and majhis who take the last name "Bhatiyali." The following are common names in Shankhabhumi:

**Feminine.** Amrapali, Bhanumati, Jamdani, Phullora
**Masculine.** Anuttom, Chakrayudh, Rudrashekhar, Udayaditya
**Gender-Neutral.** Kheya, Kobi, Palki, Ulka
