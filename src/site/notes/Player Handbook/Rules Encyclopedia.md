I will be running this campaign using 2024 5e rules. You are welcome to use 2014 material for character creation if it does not exist within current 2024 5e. I can help you adjust your character to suit 2024 rules if needed.

## House Rules
There are a few house rules I would like to implement. We will discuss them further at Session 0 and we will need to all approve before they are implemented. House Rules can be reviewed during the campaign if necessary.
- Extra Feats: at level 4, 8, 12 and 16 please pick an extra feat. Either an ASI and a Feat, or 2 Feats.
- Crunchy Crits: add max dice roll + dice roll + modifiers.
- Healing Potions: action for full healing, bonus action for rolled healing.
- Private Death Saves: Please roll your own death saves in secret (only the Player and DM to know the rolls).
