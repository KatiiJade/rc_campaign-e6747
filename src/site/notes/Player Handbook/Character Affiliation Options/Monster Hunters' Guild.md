The Monster Hunters' Guild is a loose company of adventurers helmed by [[Barham Nasri\|Barham Nasri]] from [[Atlas/Civilisations/Akharin Sangar\|Akharin Sangar]]. The Guild headquarters are located very close to the [[Passage of Respite\|Passage of Respite]], inside a small building furnished with its own armoury, arcane storehouse, and alchemist quarters. The building is decorated with stuffed heads of various monsters, including a huge purple worm maw over the gate to the inner courtyard. 

Guild members see themselves as righteous protectors, while other citizens of the Radiant Citadel — many of whom have been branded monsters in their time — see them as a dangerous force of vigilantes. Although the Guild has their headquarters in the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]], the [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Shieldbearers\|Shieldbearers]] have prohibited them from undertaking quests within in the Citadel itself, fearing unrest. Guild members wear discs of hammered gold and other sun symbols. 

All are welcome at any Guild house to attend the various weapons training and sparring sessions they conduct. There is also a small Guild shop for adventuring sundries. 

The Guild holds trials for admission, which are extremely rigorous, testing physical prowess, moral uprightness, and mental acuity. Guild members have access to the armoury and magic item collection of the Guild. The Guild maintains a list of monster sightings and posts bounties for particularly dangerous monsters, which any Guild member may collect. Bounties are not given to non- Guild members; however, the slayer of a fearsome monster may be invited to apply for membership.
