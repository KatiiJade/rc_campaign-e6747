From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears grayish and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy, limiting visibility to 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely, the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]] is usually imperceptible to those on the overlapped planes, except with the aid of magic.

Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can’t attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]] is imperceptible to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped plane don’t hamper the movement of a creature in the Border Ethereal. The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings. This makes the [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]] ideal for scouting, spying on opponents, and moving around without being detected. The [[Atlas/Planes/Ethereal Plane\|Ethereal Plane]] also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can freely move in any direction.
