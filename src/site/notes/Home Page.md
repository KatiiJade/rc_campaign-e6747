# Well met ethereal explorer!
This wiki provides player information on our Radiant Citadel campaign based on the official anthology **Journeys through the Radiant Citadel**. I will be updating this wiki with new information as we progress through the campaign. If you would like to share something from your character on this wiki, please let me know.

Thank you all for joining me on this campaign. I am excited to meet your characters!

*In the heart of the Ethereal Plane lies an ancient and mysterious city called the Radiant Citadel. Through tradition, cooperation, and ancestral magic, fifteen civilisations are bound to this wondrous site.* 
*From glittering night markets to undersea cities, from curse-afflicted villages to angel-ruled city-states, these adventures provide a pathway to never-before-seen lands and stories. The gates of the Radiant Citadel stand open, and a rich tapestry of stories is yours to explore.*

The end of each the page there is a 'Characters from' section that lists questions to think about for your character creation if your character is a denizen of the Citadel.
