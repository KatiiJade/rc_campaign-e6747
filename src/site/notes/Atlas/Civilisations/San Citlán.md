The stone-and-iron city of San Citlán stands at a confluence of ley lines, where the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead is thin. It's a place suffused with magic, where citizens commune with the dead in joyful festivals, and industrious minds create wonders of magic and technology. Despite San Citlán's rich culture and magical marvels, economic inequality is stark between the majority of its inhabitants and the wealthy landowners and technocrats who control the land's resources. These elite reap the rewards of progress with little regard for those left behind. As harsh as life can be for those in the city, the borderlands are harsher still. There, every day is a struggle to survive in the face of poverty, banditry, and drought. 

A cosmopolitan trade hub, San Citlán is home to grand plazas, vibrant markets, and countless neighbourhoods competing for space against towering industrial facilities. Smokestacks rise over cobbled streets. Silence is a commodity, as hammers ring out and forge fires roar in the city's ironworks at all hours. 

Discontent among the common people has given rise to revolutionaries in the borderlands who are determined to fight the [[Trecena\|Trecena]]—the city's ruling council—to bring an end to corruption. Outrage recently reached a fever pitch as the city reels from political instability wrought by the death of a high-profile politician, [[Doña Estela\|Doña Estela]]. She was the longest-serving member of the [[Trecena\|Trecena]], and rumours that magical resurrection will restore her to rule indefinitely have shattered the government's democratic façade. Discord brews among members of the [[Trecena\|Trecena]], some of whom support [[Doña Estela\|Doña Estela]]'s return while others vie for her coveted station.

## Pronunciation
Doña Estela - doe-nya ehs-TAY-la
Los Gavilanes - los gah-vee-LAHN-es
Milpazul - mil-PAH-zul
Olvidado - ohl-vee-DAH-doh
San Citlán - san see-TLAHN

## Legends of San Citlán
According to the tale of San Citlán's founding, an explorer named [[Citlali\|Citlali]] became lost in the valley of the [[Calaveras River\|Calaveras River]]. After wandering for days, [[Citlali\|Citlali]] saw an elegantly dressed skeletal figure trailing behind her, never moving too close or straying too far. She tried to flee, but the figure always caught up. When she turned and followed her pursuer instead, the skeleton led [[Citlali\|Citlali]] to a hidden cenote. [[Citlali\|Citlali]] dove in to assuage her thirst, and when she resurfaced, the skeletal figure was gone.

Observing that the area was rich in precious minerals, [[Citlali\|Citlali]] returned home and convinced others to join her to settle the valley north of the cenote and the mountains now known as [[Citlali's Rest\|Citlali's Rest]]. [[Citlali\|Citlali]] grew old, and the skeletal figure returned to take her, but the settlement remained. It was named in her honour, with Citlán roughly translating to "the place near Citlali." People began calling the skeletal figure [[La Catrina\|La Catrina]] for her elegant clothing.

San Citlán's history is rife with conflict. After years of failed invasions over its first century of existence, the city was overcome and occupied by a colonising force. Colonial rule lasted for two hundred years and ended in a bloody series of conflicts called the [[Wars of Separation\|Wars of Separation]]. In the aftermath, the folk of San Citlán held their first elections, finally looking forward to a time of peace. The wars have left scars, turning previously fertile lands barren and driving away the fey that once inhabited the region—some say forever.

## Noteworthy Sites
San Citlán is a land of contrasts. Lavish mansions cradle the wealthy while the poor scrape to survive. Purses are filled in lively markets and emptied in cantinas and wrestling rings. Massive industrial complexes loom over colourful homes in quaint streets and alleys.

### Papalotlán Hill
[[Papalotlán Hill\|Papalotlán Hill]] at the heart of the city is the centre of power and wealth. Councilors of the [[Trecena\|Trecena]] try to maintain order from the towers of the [[Crucible Court\|Crucible Court]], the city's seat of government. Within the enchanted halls of the [[Argent Congregation\|Argent Congregation]], the minds behind San Citlán's progress prepare future generations of spellcasting adepts. The base of the hill teems with monuments, temples, and extravagant estates. These wealthy neighbourhoods and aristocratic circles provide the backdrop for political and social intrigue.

### Marfil Ironworks
The city's primary source of wealth is the industrial collective known as [[Marfil Ironworks\|Marfil Ironworks]], which processes local minerals using a mix of innovative technology and magic. The ironworks have many complexes across the city, and these labyrinthine facilities house all kinds of wondrous experimental creations.

### Los Gavilanes
[[Los Gavilanes\|Los Gavilanes]] is the informal name given to San Citlán's old town. It's the most populous district, where ancient manors turned into collective living quarters are rented to industrial workers and their families. These buildings, known as vecindades, each house dozens of tenants and abide by complex internal community structures.

### The Borderlands and Milapzul
The dry, rocky landscape outside San Citlán offers little in the way of comfort. Over half the city's workers live in these borderlands, while many more folk labour at mines and farms in the area. These communities have suffered neglect that has led to increased banditry on top of the usual attacks by monsters. One of the largest [[borderlands\|borderlands]] settlements, [[Milpazul\|Milpazul]], caters to travellers looking for shelter. It has acquired a reputation as a hub for mercenaries, as locals turn to [[caporales\|caporales]]—traditional defenders on horseback—for security in the absence of city support.

## Life in San Citlán
Molded through generations of cosmopolitan mingling, San Citlán's culture is ever-evolving but not without honoured traditions.

### Food and Recreation
Food is a particular point of pride in San Citlán, whose peoples use it to express their heritage. Local ingredients include agave, beans, cactus, chili peppers, maize, and tomatillos. These are combined with many imported goods to create dishes from painstakingly prepared stews such as hominy-and-meat pozole to ubiquitous snacks like tacos.

For city folk, many recreations relieve the pressures of daily life. Along with music and dance, ball games are a common pastime, ranging from ancient variations played with the hip to more contemporary kicking games. Wrestling evolved into its own form of theatrical entertainment: [[La Lucha\|La Lucha]], where luchadores don colourful masks, adopt epic personas, and battle using acrobatic manoeuvres.

### Faith and Festivals
Worship is ingrained in city culture, and major religions have temples ranging from grandiose to quaint. "Don't piss outside the cantina lest you soil a temple" is a local saying that both offers etiquette advice and references the city's many centres of worship. [[La Catrina\|La Catrina]]—believed to be death herself—is the patron spirit of the city. She is a capricious figure who wishes to be celebrated rather than feared.

While numerous festivals are held throughout the year, the most splendid and anticipated is the Night of the Remembered, a celebration that evolved from ancient funerary rites and draws on the magic of the city. During this night, people can be visited by deceased loved ones if they honour them with an ofrenda: food and drink enjoyed in life, among other traditional offerings, presented on elaborate altars that guide souls back to the world. The days leading up to this event are marked by colourful citywide parades that display San Citlán's diverse culture.

### Olvidados
In rare circumstances, the deceased remain in San Citlán as Undead following the [[Night of the Remembered\|Night of the Remembered]]. Known as [[olvidados\|olvidados]], or "forgotten," these intelligent Undead often take the form of sapient, peaceful skeletons or spirits. Most retain the memories and personality they had in life, but they have no recollection of the afterlife.

### Governance and Growth
San Citlán is governed by the [[Trecena\|Trecena]], a council consisting of thirteen elected representatives. The ability to vote for these representatives is limited to landowners and their descendants, those who serve in the military, graduates of the [[Argent Congregation\|Argent Congregation]], and those who make a considerable contribution to the city's economy.

In recent decades, the city has undergone significant transformations marked by great discoveries attributed to the Argent Congregation. [[Doña Estela\|Doña Estela]], a dwarf landowner who held a seat in the [[Trecena\|Trecena]] for more than fifty years, was the congregation's founder and is credited with San Citlán's economic rise. However, her focus on progress and city aesthetics has drawn heavy criticism, as the majority of the populace lives in poverty. The seat of [[Councilor of the Foundry\|Councilor of the Foundry]] remains vacant following [[Doña Estela\|Doña Estela]]'s recent death, as it has become clear that the oligarch intended to be resurrected to continue her rule indefinitely.
