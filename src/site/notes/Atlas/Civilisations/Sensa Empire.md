The Sensa Empire runs on gold. Its three principal city-states—[[Anisa\|Anisa]], [[Niba\|Niba]], and [[Tarikh\|Tarikh]]—were each built around gold mines, and as their wealth has grown, so has their population, influence, and foreign trade. Most of the empire is arid and difficult to cultivate, so the regions between the city-states are sparsely inhabited and often lack the resources available in cosmopolitan areas. Still, the city-states and the outlands are tied together by [[Empress Inaya\|Empress Inaya]]'s rule, with each city governed autonomously by a hereditary monarch subject to the empress's ultimate authority. 

Though the Sensa Empire is known as a peaceful realm, it faces a rocky transition of power. The next ruler is traditionally chosen from among the three city-states' royal families, excluding the direct descendants of the current ruler. But for years, [[Empress Inaya\|Empress Inaya]] quietly made it known that she planned to appoint her own son to follow her—and in so doing, seemingly brought down a legendary curse that claimed the lives of her husband and eldest son. When the grieving empress announced she would appoint her successor from among the royal families of [[Anisa\|Anisa]], [[Niba\|Niba]], or [[Tarikh\|Tarikh]] as tradition dictated, the rulers of the city-states began to fight for favour—and competition for that favour is brutal. 

## Features
Those familiar with the Sensa Empire know the following facts: 
**Hallmarks.** The empire is a collection of cosmopolitan city-states known for its expert goldsmiths and fabulous wealth. 
**People.** Most residents of the region are dark-skinned humans with brown eyes and tightly coiled dark hair. These features are shared by dwarves and elves in the region. Other species including drow and goliaths also reside here in small numbers.
**Languages.** Sensan is the native language of the region, and most imperial citizens also speak Common. 

## Noteworthy Sites
The Sensa Empire is structured around the three city-states of [[Anisa\|Anisa]], [[Niba\|Niba]], and [[Tarikh\|Tarikh]], each a wealthy oasis in an arid and unforgiving landscape.
### Anisa
The city-state of [[Anisa\|Anisa]], in the east of Sensa, is ruled by the aging [[King Diara\|King Diara]]. Thanks to the wealth of the [[Goldwarren\|Goldwarren]] mine, the city's gold production far outpaces that of its neighbours. The people value education highly, and the city is home to [[Anisa Academy\|Anisa Academy]], the only university in the empire. Politically, the city has enjoyed years of peace under [[King Diara\|King Diara]]'s rule, but many dread his inevitable retirement. While the king's heir—his oldest child, [[Simbon\|Simbon]]—waffles on how seriously he takes his responsibilities, Diara's daughter, [[Zahra\|Zahra]], seeks to replace her brother as heir to the throne.

### Niba
The city-state of [[Niba\|Niba]] lies along Sensa's southeastern coast. Ruled by [[Queen Sainesha\|Queen Sainesha]], the city is known for its grand bazaars and for being home to some of the most talented goldsmiths in the region. Entertainment in the form of cafes, theaters, and raceways is also central to life in the city. Among [[Niba\|Niba]]'s many celebrities is the queen's firstborn and heir, the ambitious and charismatic [[Prince Kirina\|Prince Kirina]].

### Tarikh
The city-state of [[Tarikh\|Tarikh]] lies in Sensa's northwestern reaches, nestled against jagged peaks. Its young ruler, [[King Sundasha\|King Sundasha]], balances commercial needs and the local environment, as the city's scattered oases provide it with some of the only arable land in the region. While much of this land provides for the empire's people, a significant fraction is used to grow feed for the city's prized herds of camels. Tarikh also hosts the [[Seven Stairs\|Seven Stairs]], the headquarters of the [[Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet\|Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet]].

### The Azure Dome
The deep-blue dome of [[Empress Inaya\|Empress Inaya]]'s coastal palace holds the seat of the Sensa Empire's power. Within the [[Azure Dome\|Azure Dome]], the empress meets with her councillors and entertains the rulers of her three city-states. Merely entering the [[Azure Dome\|Azure Dome]] is considered a high honour for citizens of the empire.

The [[Azure Dome\|Azure Dome]]'s legendary security couldn't protect [[Empress Inaya\|Empress Inaya]]'s husband and eldest son, [[Salaba\|Salaba]] and [[Shayan\|Shayan]], from dying under unusual circumstances. Both passed away in their sleep after a state dinner—as they were in perfect health, it's believed they were poisoned by an unknown hand.

### Tomb of the Faceless
Half a day's ride north from [[Tarikh\|Tarikh]], the [[Tomb of the Faceless\|Tomb of the Faceless]] stands alone in the desert. A site of ritual pilgrimage and worship, the tomb is a large golden dome without an entrance that holds the Prophet's bones. The Prophet was a respected scholar and reformer adamant that her persona not eclipse her teachings. She insisted that after her death her followers not repeat her name or depict her face in art. Today, the faithful leave offerings of gold and salt at the site, which are collected at dusk by the clergy known as the [[Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet\|Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet]].

According to the acolytes who tend the tomb, learning the Prophet's name grants forbidden and dangerous power. Every so often, someone attempts to break into the tomb in search of clues to the Prophet's identity—a crime punished by permanent exile from the empire.

## Life in the Sensa Empire
Those who live in the Sensa Empire or who travel through the land experience its wealth, both in riches and deep traditions.

### Aurum Guild
Gold mining is a respected career, crucial to the empire's prosperity. Those who work with the riches of the earth number among the land's most respect artisans and have few peers. To support its members, the [[Aurum Guild\|Aurum Guild]] allows miners and craftspeople to build social and professional connections, better their craft, and organize for improved labour conditions. Each city-state has its own chapter of the guild that pushes back when local rulers make unfair demands of miners for personal benefit—often placing the guild in conflict with those rulers.

### Life and Legends
The empire is known for its rich tradition of oral storytelling, in which traveling historian-storytellers known as griots pass down tales from generation to generation. The most common tales are of [[Emperor Kassa\|Emperor Kassa]], who founded the Sensa Empire after defeating the now-extinct aurumvoraxes—gold-eating predators—that once plagued the region.

The arid land of the Sensan Empire has inspired simple fashions, and Sensans of all genders wear loose cotton tunics, trousers, dresses, or caftans to stay cool. The region's deserts provide limited opportunities for agriculture. While spices and preserved foods are frequently imported, ocean-caught whitefish and locally grown plantains, cassava, and yams serve as staples of the Sensan diet.

### Split Rule
The Sensa Empire's three city-states are hereditary monarchies united into a coalition under the empress's control. Historically, rather than a single imperial line controlling the throne, each empress or emperor selects an heir from among the eldest children of each city-state's monarch. While no law prevents rulers from selecting their own children as heirs, few do so, fearing they'll fall victim to a terrible curse. Heirs are usually chosen based on merit.

### Wealth of the Empire
With gold abundant in the Sensa Empire, there's no lack of lucrative, respected jobs in the mines, though the work comes with occupational hazards. But the wealth of the empire often draws threats. Banditry is an ongoing problem, and sometimes diplomacy is all that prevents raids from neighbouring territories.

## Characters from Sensa Empire
If players want to create a character from the Sensa Empire, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**What city-state do you originate from?** Are you staunchly loyal to your home city? If you grew up in the hostile outlands, how did your family survive?
**Have you worked with the earth or its riches?** Mining and goldsmithing are respected work in the Sensa Empire—are you experienced with such work? Do you bear scars from such labor? If you avoided it, why?
**How does gold impact your life?** The Sensa Empire's prosperity comes at a price—have you experienced these costs personally? Have you ever been targeted by bandits? Are there any resources you want or need that can't be bought?
