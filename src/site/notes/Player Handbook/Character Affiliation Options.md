For this campaign you may select a faction or organisation that your character is affiliated with. You can pick from the list below or work with me to create a different one. Your characters could have separate affiliations or the same affiliation (also called a group patron). If you wish your character may have no affiliations.

The party can change patrons during the campaign.

## What is a Group Patron?
Each adventuring group is bound together by the quests they embark on and by the dangers its members face together. Group patrons offers another way to bind your party together. These patrons provide a strong binding element: an individual or an organisation that unites a party as a team in service to a greater purpose. 

A group patron can help set the tone of your party’s entire campaign. For example, a group whose patron is an academic institution is likely to have a very different story from a group that serves a military. A patron can influence characters’ relationships, their backstories, and the types of dangers they face.

### Group Patron Types

### How Patrons Work
The following sections present several group patron options. The description of each patron provides an overview of the types of organisations the group patron represents, perks of membership, and quests the patron encourages adventurers to undertake.

#### Group Assistance
Having a group patron gives an adventuring group a common purpose, which inspires better coordination in the form of guidance and encouragement. As a result of this unity, each member of the party can grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw of another member of the party. To grant advantage in this way, a character and the chosen target must be able to see or hear each other, and neither can be incapacitated. Once a party member grants this advantage, that individual can’t do so again until they finish a long rest.

If the party chooses separate affiliations instead of a group patron, they will not receive this feature until level 3.

#### Perks
Your affiliated organisation or NPC offers your character/party a number of perks for your service. These range from standard business arrangements, such as a steady wage and access to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific perks are presented in the description of each group patron.

#### Campaign Specific Benefits
The [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]] require that basic income and housing is provided to all at the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]].  
As such, your affiliated organisation or NPC will provide basic income that covers food, water, and common needs, along with basic housing such as a dormitory or share house style.  
If you choose not to have an affiliation that can provide this, you will either be a refugee sheltered at the [[Factions & Organisations/Palace of Exile\|Palace of Exile]] or a denizen provided with public housing and basic income by the [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Speakers for the Ancestors\|Speakers for the Ancestors]].


### Types of Assignments
It might help to think of the affiliated NPC or organisation in terms of three broad categories of autonomy:

With a **highly directive** patron, you are an employee of an organisation, and the organisation often tells you what to do.
With a **highly autonomous** patron, you are more like a freelancer. Your patron might offer you assignments or reward you for achieving certain objectives, but it doesn’t dictate your activities.
In a **player-directed** organisation, you don’t have a patron because your adventuring party is in charge. You’re the boss; you tell others what to do, and you’re responsible to no one for your own activities. 

### Important Notes
The organisations have suggested roles for the player characters, sometimes including classes, backgrounds, and skills. Please note these are suggestions. Party composition and character creation is up to you.
