The House of Convalescence focuses the life-giving energies of the [[Auroral Diamond\|Auroral Diamond]], allowing for incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It also draws clerics and healers of many traditions. Most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of the place itself.


## Magic in the House of Convalescence
Magic is affected in the following ways in the House of Convalescence:

**Diamond Components.** When the spells raise dead, resurrection, revivify, or true resurrection are cast in the House of Convalescence, a diamond material component is never required.
**Hit Point Maximum.** When creatures would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, they instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, a spellcaster restores 12.
