[[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options/Speaker Sholeh\|Sholeh]] and her expeditious adventurers created new terms for years system that is used on the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]].

**AS stands for Age of Silence** and represents the time before the Radiant Citadel was rediscovered.
