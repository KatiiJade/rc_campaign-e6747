Zinda is a city of spiraling marble towers and turrets, of universities and guildhalls, and of specialty shops lining paved streets. Far below the balconies, the [[Court of Flowers\|Court of Flowers]] and the pier ring with the merry laughter and the songs of labourers. Year round, Zinda's plazas and parlours are full of academics, merchants, and pilgrims. But for ten days in the summer, the [[March of Vice\|March of Vice]] draws even larger crowds as the city celebrates the local wine trade—specifically, the [[jeli wine\|jeli wine]] that has made Zinda the wealthiest city in the land. Zindanese citizens garb themselves in brightly coloured costumes and feathered headdresses and indulge in feasting, song, and dance.

After its recent years of prosperity, a cloud has settled over the city. Political dissidents are rumoured to disappear from their beds as the Silent Verse, the enforcers of the ruling [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]], stalk the streets. The newest member of the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]], [[Madame Samira Arah\|Madame Samira Arah]], grows restless with ambition and regularly hires mercenaries and spies to investigate her rivals' secrets. The [[Bloodletters\|Bloodletters]] labourers' union opposes the leadership of the aristocracy at every turn. And beneath it all, the dire secret on which Zinda's prosperity was built waits to be exposed.

## Features
Those familiar with Zinda know the following facts: 
**Hallmarks.** Zinda's people are known for cultivating the jeli flower, which features prominently in the annual March of Vice celebration. 
**People of Zinda**. Humans make up the majority of Zinda's population and have skin tones ranging from light brown to black. Their hair grows in spiral curls; most grow it long and wear it tucked beneath a headscarf topped by a wide-brimmed hat (if married) or set in scalp-hugging braids (if unmarried). Elves and halflings are also frequently seen in Zinda, along with other nonhumans. 
**Languages.** All Zindanese citizens speak Common and N'warian. Many Zindanese also speak Draconic, since the power and wealth typically attributed to dragons are considered virtuous to the Kings of Coin. 

## Legends of Zinda
In the oldest legends, spirits of the jungle and ocean worked together to create Zinda where fire once met the sea, creating the black volcanic sand above which the city stands. These beings raised stone buildings from the earth, shifting rivers and trees to accommodate them. Satisfied with their creations, the ancestral apparitions welcomed the first Zindanese. Lately, the [[datura\|datura]] who walk the jungles warn that these spirits are agitated and seek appeasement from Zinda for its avarice.

The festival called the [[March of Vice\|March of Vice]] shares similar supernatural origins. Tales tell of wicked spirits corrupting the people before being cast into the sea by a parade of elders. This legend is commemorated every summer through the [[March of Vice\|March of Vice]], with the members of the [[Covenant of Magic\|Covenant of Magic]] assuming the mantle of the elders.

## Noteworthy Sites
In addition to its robust agricultural holdings, Zinda is home to magical universities, conservatories, museums, and other centres of the arts.

### Court of Flowers
The [[Court of Flowers\|Court of Flowers]] is the vibrant heart of commerce and art in Zinda. The district hosts streets lined with multiple palatial homes, towers with overflowing gardens, and museums. Performers gather here throughout the day, and merchants keep their shops open day and night. Most of the city's guilds—known in the city as trades—keep their headquarters among the district's towers. Artisans are expected to register with the headquarters of the appropriate trade and support the furthering of their craft.

### Covenant of Magic
Hunched over brass cauldrons in their manor-like headquarters, members of the [[Covenant of Magic\|Covenant of Magic]]—an exclusive circle of traditionalist mages—preside over festivals, weddings, funerals, and similar events. Most covenant members are elderly; several have great-great-grandchildren who lead their own trades or are [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]]. Their power stems less from magic and more from their far-reaching connections.

### Elucidarium
The bardic college of Zinda, the [[Elucidarium\|Elucidarium]], is the extravagant home of the famous divas of Zinda. Draped in bright silk and exuberant florals, the building is made of sculpted glass set with sparkling gemstones. Inside, musicians, dancers, orators, and thespians hone their talents. In addition to these public skills, students can also study spy-craft and information brokering. Those who visit looking for training in the arts might find themselves embroiled in the machinations of ruthless social climbers.

### [[Jeli Gardens\|Jeli Gardens]]
The great gardens that spread to the west of the city are the source of Zinda's wealth. Many Zindanese laborers tend the [[jeli flowers\|jeli flowers]] that grow there, living in wood-and-stone huts in the heart of the gardens. These velvety flowers were discovered several years ago and can't be successfully cultivated elsewhere. 

Why Zinda is the only place where [[jeli flowers\|jeli flowers]] can grow is a mystery, but this single crop now supplies the city with raw materials for wine, dye, fabric, and paper. Gardeners occasionally fall prey to wicked spirits, zombies, and green hags that lurk in the jungle beyond the city, as Zinda has no standing army to protect these outlying regions.

## Life in Zinda
Art, commerce, and magic fill the lives of Zinda's people and touch on every aspect of society.

### The Bloodletters
Clad in aprons stained with jeli dye, [[Bloodletters\|Bloodletters]] proselytize a life free from oppression by the elite. The group's name originates from its members' desire to drain the greed from Zinda like blood from a wound. Under the leadership of [[Captain Adann\|Captain Adann]], the group works in open defiance of the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]]. The [[Bloodletters\|Bloodletters]]' attacks upon the [[Court of Flowers\|Court of Flowers]] and sabotage of the [[jeli gardens\|jeli gardens]] make the group a frequent target of the [[Silent Verse\|Silent Verse]].

### Class Divide
Zinda has a stark class divide. The city's wealthy citizens live in large homes and revere academia, a strong work ethic, and wealth. Members of less affluent families sleep together in cramped quarters and often hold multiple jobs to survive. The rich feast on goat, fish, and mutton; wear gold and silk; and drink from spotless glass flutes while boasting of their academic achievements and frivolously displaying magic. The poor eat grains and roots served on palm leaves spread upon straw floors.

### Faith and Ancestors
Though Zinda welcomes the practices of all citizens, the city's one common faith involves the [[daturas\|daturas]], also known as spirit shepherds. [[Daturas\|Daturas]] speak for and protect the spirits of the jungle. A [[datura\|datura]] might go years without meeting another member of the order, spending their life escorting caravans, performing exorcisms, and guarding sacred reaches of the forest. Others are hired to escort mourners to the sites of rare silk cotton trees, where the bereaved hang tokens for their recently departed ancestors. In some homes, particularly among the wealthy, whole rooms might be given over to altars intricately decorated to honour a family's ancestors.

### March of Vice
During the height of summer, the people of Zinda celebrate the cultivation of the jeli flower with a multiday carnival. Built on traditions celebrating the city's wine trade, the [[March of Vice\|March of Vice]] is overseen by the [[Prince of Vice\|Prince of Vice]]—an organiser and theatrical figure. Chosen by the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]], the masked [[Prince of Vice\|Prince of Vice]] marches in the parade every evening. The parade is followed by the [[Covenant of Magic\|Covenant of Magic]], magic-using elders who wave fans and brooms, symbolically sweeping Zinda's sin into the sea. On the tenth night, the [[Prince of Vice\|Prince of Vice]] steps into the sea and sheds their mask, bringing the festivities to a close.

### Kings of Coin
The [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]] are the ruling council of Zinda, a collection of six elders from affluent families that represent specific trades. Their meetings occur weekly at the gilded collection of offices and towers known as the [[Vault of Justice\|Vault of Justice]]. The following individuals currently hold positions on the council:

**[[Grand Messer Amos Nir\|Grand Messer Amos Nir]]** is head of the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]] and represents the [[Jeli Trade\|Jeli Trade]]. He is the wealthiest, most influential leader in Zinda.
**[[Madame Kit Mata\|Madame Kit Mata]]** represents the Grocers' Trade.
**[[Madame Samira Arah\|Madame Samira Arah]]** is the newest member of the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]]. She represents the Jewelers' Trade and oversees the [[Silent Verse\|Silent Verse]] as head of security for the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]].
**[[Messer Solenn Avim\|Messer Solenn Avim]]** represents the Weavers' Trade.
**[[Myx Nargis Ruba\|Myx Nargis Ruba]]** represents the Tavern Keepers' Trade.
**[[Myx Massimo Ain\|Myx Massimo Ain]]** represents the Smiths' Trade.

The [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]] keep order using their vast wealth, their societal influence, and the [[Silent Verse\|Silent Verse]]—the rulers' police force. The [[Silent Verse\|Silent Verse]] protects the [[Kings of Coin\|Kings of Coin]], collects information, and issues shadowy threats to keep political rivals in line.
## Characters from Zinda
If players want to create characters native to Zinda, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Are you affiliated with any of the organizations in Zinda?** Do you belong to the Bloodletters or the Silent Verse? Should laborers be permitted the same rights as plutocratic rulers?
**How do you celebrate the March of Vice?** Do you revel with friends and local laborers? Do you attend galas among the wealthy? Do you perform in sequins and feathers as a Elucidarium diva?
**What do you know of the forest's spirits?** Have you trained as a mystical datura to hear spirits' voices and learn their ways?

### Names

**Feminine.** Inyz, Larisa, Onika, Tanea
**Masculine.** Emran, Jacapo, Melo, Solenn
**Gender-Neutral.** Amal, Elar, Jari, Pirro
