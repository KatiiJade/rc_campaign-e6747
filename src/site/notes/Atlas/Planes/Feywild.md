The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a place of music and magic. The plane responds to unfettered emotion: flowers turn and tremble in the presence of a heated argument, grass withers under the feet of one who seethes with malice, and birds chip merrily in the presence of those who are joyous and squawk angrily at those who are dour.

Time and distance in the Feywild are mutable, as is the plane’s geography. Roads are uncommon, and the ones that exist change as frequently as the land around themselves. Feywild natives are accustomed to the plane’s mutability, but it can be terribly disorienting to visitors.

The Feywild exists in parallel to the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] as an alternate dimension that occupies the same cosmological space. When moving from the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] to the Feywild, travellers usually find themselves in a location similar to the one they left, but more marvellous and magical—and often more vibrant and colourful, too. Adventurers climbing a volcano on the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] might suddenly find themselves scaling a Feywild mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire. Leaving behind a wide and muddy river on the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]], characters might appear beside a clear and winding brook whose waters glitter like diamonds in the Feywild. In the heart of a dismal marsh might lie a portal leading to a vast bog filled with eerie lights and sinister shapes twisting in the water. And moving to the Feywild from old ruins on the [[Atlas/Planes/Material Plane\|Material Plane]] might put a traveller at the door of an archfey’s castle.
