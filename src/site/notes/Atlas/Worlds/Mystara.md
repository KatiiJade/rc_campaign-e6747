**Mystara** was a planet located in an unknown crystal sphere carefully hidden from the rest of the [[Atlas/Multiverse\|Multiverse]] and yet was numbered among the worlds best known throughout the multiverse.

“Mystara is strange, beautiful, and a testament to the sheer variety of worlds in the multiverse. . . . Every time I visit Mystara, I can't help but wonder at how it works and the minds that came together to fashion this marvel from the elemental forces of the Inner Planes. But this world in particular has strange origins and an even stranger design, which leads me to wonder if there is some reason why Mystara is the way it is.”
— Mordenkainen

The planet of Mystara was orbited by two moons, a visible one known as Matera and an invisible one known as Myoshima. And the Wildspace of their crystal sphere differed from others in that it was extremely cold.
