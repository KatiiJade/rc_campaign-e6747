The Speakers for the Ancestors are the ruling body of the [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]]. Candidates are chosen through an election among the diaspora of the people they represent. Once a candidate has been elected, they must face the founding [[Dawn Incarnates\|Dawn Incarnates]] and pass their tests. 

Once a Speaker for the Ancestors is chosen, they hold office for ten years. At the end of their tenure, they can step down; if they don't, they must face the same selection process again.

As founding civilisations are rediscovered and join the Radiant Citadel, the council is expanded, and the new Speakers gain power equal to that of their peers.

## A Speaker's Role
The Speakers for the Ancestors face incredible challenges in their role. They must maintain the internal stability of a large and diverse city and ensure its people are treated equally and fairly under the law. Simultaneously, they manage a complex relationship with the founding civilisations.  
While decisions by the Speakers are made by simple majority, each Speaker has a very powerful veto that prevents them from being marginalised by political alliances.

## Main Objective
Assist the Speaker's in managing governance of the Citadel and maintaining diplomatic relations between the Citadel and Civilisations, including new Civilisations.

## Assignments
Characters to take on a variety of assigements involving politics and diplomacy. This patron's assignments will be more social based than combat.

### Limitations
The Speakers' first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel's policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilisations or otherwise.

However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources.

## Benefits
- Starting salary of 10gp.
- Accommodation and travel expenses covered for off-Citadel assignments.
- Diplomatic immunity (as long as you stay in their good graces).
- Access to high echelons of society. 
- Access to equipment and research.
- Proficiency in one of Deception, History, Insight, Investigation, or Persuasion.
