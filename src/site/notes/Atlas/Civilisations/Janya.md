Modern [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] is a coastal realm descended from a grand civilisation. Though the nation has never been defeated by external forces, its fortunes were greatly diminished hundreds of years ago after raiders perpetrated atrocities upon the land and its people in a series of attacks known as the [[Passage of Vultures\|Passage of Vultures]]. [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]]'s defenders drove the raiders off, albeit at a high cost. Even in its diminished state, the nation serves as an exemplar of self-sovereignty and dignity, defended by scouts known as the [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]], who watch for bandit groups and marauders aiming to raid [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] and its neighbours. 

During the [[Passage of Vultures\|Passage of Vultures]], countless captured Djaynaians leaped from the ships of the marauders, like raindrops falling into the sea. "Freedom now!" they shouted as they sought the ocean's embrace. In the midnight depths, those ancient Djaynaians called upon their magic and that of the [[Nightsea\|Nightsea]], and they were transformed into beings dubbed [[Nightsea Chil-liren\|Nightsea Chil-liren]], gifted with the ability to live in the deep. Over centuries, they became the civilisation known as Janya. 

## Pronunciation
Chil-liren - CHILL-l'ren
Djaynai - JAY-nigh
Janya - JAN-yuh

## Features
Those familiar with Janya typically know the following details: 
**Hallmarks.** These lands are known for their ancestral legacies, political schisms, and transformed cultures. 
**Janya's People.** Janyans are an amphibious people of Djaynaian descent called Nightsea Chil-liren . They typically resemble lithe humans with sharp teeth and ribbon-like fins along their appendages. Their skin tones are usually desaturated shades of gray-brown. 
**Janya's Languages.** The people of Janya speak an archaic form of Djaynaian that allows easy if slow communication with people who speak the modern tongue, as well as Common and Aquan. 

## Legends of Djaynai and Janya
[[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] has been a beacon of independence and knowledge for millennia. Indeed, [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] has ultimately prevailed over all invaders, with a key role played by the mystical practices known as the [[Blackmist Way\|Blackmist Way]] and [[Blackthrone Arts\|Blackthrone Arts]]. Unfortunately, [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]]'s friendly neighbouring realms are more often threatened. For instance, inscrutable [[lizardfolk\|lizardfolk]] in the wetlands periodically congregate and cause havoc in the nearby ocean. The [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]]—who take their name from the shallow coastal waters Djaynaians call the [[Lightsea\|Lightsea]]—was formed to monitor such threats before they impact [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]]. Travellers occasionally come to [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] to learn the [[Lightsea Lancers\|Lightsea Lancers]]' ways, as their heroics, dance-like martial arts, and knowledge of transmutation magic are renowned throughout [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] and beyond.

Beneath the [[Nightsea\|Nightsea]], the realm of Janya has its own tales. Many tell of how early Janyans were focused not only on rebuilding their lives but on preserving what they treasured from the land above. To keep such lore safe, ancestral Janyans built structures in hidden reaches, like the [[Trench of Love Lost\|Trench of Love Lost]], to archive sacred wisdom before it was lost. Eventually, though, such archives faded from memory. Profound Djaynaian secrets remain hidden in the deep, awaiting rekindling.

Modern Janya is a majestic, deep-sea city protected by magical wards that resemble an opalescent aurora with the sheen of a blue-black pearl. Its buildings are castle-like structures resembling those of [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] above, but made from magically hardened, obsidian-hued silt and studded by crystalline support beams jutting from the smooth walls.

## Noteworthy Sites
[[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] is a peaceful land dominated by mangrove forests along the southern coast and jagged cliffs to the north. Its calm coastal waters are known as the [[Lightsea\|Lightsea]], but beyond a continental shelf the waters grow suddenly deeper. This is the [[Nightsea\|Nightsea]], the shadowy depths that hold the vibrant city of Janya.

### Trench of Love Lost
This great undersea trench near Janya resonates with mystery and foreboding. It is named in memory of the countless Djaynaians who vanished into its depths during the earliest days of the [[Passage of Vultures\|Passage of Vultures]], before the first [[Nightsea Chil-liren\|Nightsea Chil-liren]] came to be. The trench is defined by the pale-pink meadows of feathery creatures known as sea lilies that grow along its edges. Scouts of Janya's [[Billowing Patrol\|Billowing Patrol]] have explored only a small fraction of the trench, which contains the wrecks of numerous ships and mysterious sites.

### Cerulean Lyceum
A center of culture in Janya, the [[Cerulean Lyceum\|Cerulean Lyceum]] is a great bardic college with a connected series of vaulted halls set around a broad quadrangle. Icicle-like spikes surround the [[Cerulean Lyceum\|Cerulean Lyceum]]'s main conservatory, which resembles a massive blue crystal. [[Djaynju\|Djaynju]], opera from [[Djayna\|Djayna]]i, is just one of the many musical forms practiced and 

## Life in Djaynai and Janya
The following truths are known to people who dwell in Djaynai or [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]], and to travellers who spend time in those realms. Those above and below the sea share similar cultures and values, though [[Atlas/Civilisations/Janya\|Janya]]'s aquatic environment drives some differences.

### Education and Religion
Both realms' culture is tightly tied to [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]]'s historical roots as an advanced, influential civilisation. Education and creativity are the foundations of the culture, and its people embrace philosophy, magic, mathematics, and the study of underwater societies. In keeping with these traditions, spirituality isn't focused on gods, but on revering and emulating forces such as liberation, fluidity, and change. As such, most people are open to the spiritual views of others, as long as those views don't embrace evil.

### Food and Clothing
Meals are considered sacred in [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]], and wasting food is a major breach of etiquette. Key ingredients of [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]]'s cuisine include banana, groundnut, milk from several types of animals, red and black beans, and chili peppers. In Janya, edible undersea plants form the bulk of people's diet, supplemented by ingredients imported from [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]]. As a rule, both peoples eschew eating meat.

Djaynaian clothing combines rough-spun and delicate materials, and it is common to see linen with lace or damask with crocheted fabrics in the same outfit. Most Djaynaians wear a form of shawl or cloak at all times, and their fashion favors muted colors. Headwear is typically worn in public, most commonly cowls with pointed caps, wide-brimmed hats, or tagelmusts and tasuwarts that can function as headgear and veil. Clothing in Janya parallels Djaynaian style but features materials like eel skin and elegantly woven sea grasses.

### Government in Janya
Janya is an oligarchy ruled by a group called the [[High Court\|High Court]], some members of which are able to contact key leaders in [[Atlas/Civilisations/Djaynai\|Djaynai]] on rare occasions through magical means. Members of the [[High Court\|High Court]]—and the many agents and liaisons who serve it—work in the city's magnificent [[Council Chamber\|Council Chamber]], which is housed within the shell of a gigantic whelk. However, friction between the Djaynaist and New Janyan factions of the [[High Court\|High Court]] can turn meetings into fraught debates.

The security forces of Janya are called the [[Billowing Patrol\|Billowing Patrol]], named for their flowing, dark robes. Their headquarters is a looming silvery fortress guarded by imposing sentries in armour bristling with spikes.
### Music
Traditional music in both realms functions to spiritually transfigure listeners. It emphasizes low tones and syncopated rhythms, utilizing stringed instruments such as the lute-like guembri, akoting, and xalam; the musical bow known as the berimbau; and the sonorous atabaque drum.
