The Material Plane is where the philosophical and elemental forces of the other planes of existence collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and matter. It is a thoroughly magical place, reflected in the two planes that share its central place in the multiverse.

The [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]] and the [[Atlas/Planes/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]] are parallel dimensions occupying the same cosmological space as the Material Plane. The landscapes of these three planes are similar, but those of the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]] are more marvellous and whimsical, while those of the [[Atlas/Planes/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]] are more bleak and ominous. Passage between the Material Plane and these other realms is sometimes effortless, even accidental. Adventurers might enter a grove of trees on the Material Plane and suddenly find themselves in a lush, colourful forest on the [[Atlas/Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]] or a grim wood of dead trees on the [[Atlas/Planes/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]].

## Wildspace
Bobbing in the Astral Plane like corks in an ocean are vast, airless expanses called Wildspace systems. In these systems, the Astral Plane overlaps with the Material Plane, and the stars and planets of the Material Plane are accessible from the Astral Plane. Every world of the Material Plane is situated in a Wildspace system.

As an Astral traveler approaches a Wildspace system, the silver fog of the Astral Plane gradually thins until it falls away in Wildspace. Then the sun of the Wildspace system comes into view—often millions of miles away—along with colorful gas clouds, planets, moons, and other cosmic bodies.

A Wildspace system teems with space-dwelling life-forms, including spores, plankton, and larger creatures that resemble fish and aquatic mammals. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and exist on both the Astral Plane and Material Plane simultaneously. This overlap enables creatures to use spells such as *Teleport* to travel from Wildspace to a nearby world, or vice versa. A creature or ship traveling from one Wildspace system to another must cross the Astral Plane unless it has some other magical means of traveling from one world to another. 

The Material Plane exists of wildspaces such as [[Atlas/Wildspaces/Greyspace\|Greyspace]], [[Atlas/Wildspaces/Krynnspace\|Krynnspace]], and [[Atlas/Wildspaces/Realmspace\|Realmspace]] that are similar to solar systems. Other planets/worlds exist completely on their own.
