**Shyr** was a continent on the planet of [[Atlas/Worlds/Abeir\|Abeir]]. It was the equivalent in that world to the Torilian continent of Faerûn.

The only country of this continent known to the sages of Faerûn was the realm of Shyr, of which Akanûl was once part of, until it was exchanged with parts of the lands of Chondath and western Chessenta, which in turn became part of that Abeiran continent.

## Locations
