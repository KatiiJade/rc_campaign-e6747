# Well met ethereal explorer!
This wiki provides player information on our Radiant Citadel campaign based on the official anthology **Journeys through the Radiant Citadel**. I will be updating this wiki with new information as we progress through the campaign. If you would like to share something from your character on this wiki, please let me know.
Thank you all for joining me on this campaign. I am excited to meet your characters!

*In the heart of the Ethereal Plane lies an ancient and mysterious city called the Radiant Citadel. Through tradition, cooperation, and ancestral magic, fifteen civilisations are bound to this wondrous site.* 
*From glittering night markets to undersea cities, from curse-afflicted villages to angel-ruled city-states, these adventures provide a pathway to never-before-seen lands and stories. The gates of the Radiant Citadel stand open, and a rich tapestry of stories is yours to explore.*

## Recommended Reading
To start off the campaign there a four pages that I recommend you read.
1. [[Player Handbook/Campaign Information\|Campaign Information]] - will provide you with basic campaign information, character creation details, and the call to adventure.
2. [[Atlas/Radiant Citadel\|Radiant Citadel]] - will provide you with some information on the Radiant Citadel. We will begin our campaign in this location. It could also be you character's origin/home.
3. [[Atlas/Great Civilisations\|Great Civilisations]] - will provide you with some brief information on the Great Civilisations. You may read all the Great Civilisation pages as well if you wish, but that is not necessary. They are there for you to use one as your character's origin/home.
4. [[Player Handbook/Character Affiliation Options\|Character Affiliation Options]] - will provided you with details on organisation or NPC affiliations that your character may start with.
